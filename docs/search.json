    "text": "Preface\nThese lecture notes are for a very short course—roughly twelve 75-minute lectures—on international macroeconomics that I have taught to junior and senior undergraduates. Although no prior knowledge of economics is assumed, students typically come to the course after completing courses on introductory microeconomics and macroeconomics.\nThis course is the second half of a one-semester course on international economics, with the first half on international trade. The course’s textbook is Krugman, Obstfeld, and Melitz (2022). My goal here is simply to present a concise version of chapters 13 through 18 of that book.\nI had to grapple with some tough trade-offs because of the severe time constraint. The core of the course is the theoretical framework originally proposed by Robert A. Mundell and J. Marcus Fleming. I assume perfect capital mobility throughout and, thereby, avoid all discussion of wealth effects and portfolio theory.1 I also assume a “small” country and, thereby, avoid the complex interactions of two-country models. The perfect capital mobility and small country assumptions keep this course very similar to the undergraduate macroeconomics course that most of my students would have also taken. This simplicity, I think, allows students to focus on the special aspects of international macroeconomics without having to learn a new kind of macroeconomics.\nHowever, the discussion of expectations here may surprise even students who have taken intermediate macroeconomics courses. I have broken up the discussion of short-run analysis into separate chapters on permanent and temporary changes in exogenous variables. Expectations are assumed to be anchored to the long-run equilibrium outcome. This assumption is at the root of the need to distinguish between temporary and permanent changes in, say, fiscal policy. A temporary change affects neither the long-run equilibrium outcome nor people’s expectations, which are, after all, assumed to be tied to the long-run equilibrium outcome. On the other hand, a permanent change in, say, government spending affects the long-run equilibrium level of the future value of the exchange rate and, consequently, people’s expectations about the future value of the exchange rate. This change in expectations has short-run ramifications that are absent in the analysis of temporary changes in government spending.\nThese notions are present in Krugman, Obstfeld, and Melitz (2022), but are not developed in a way that is clear enough and leisurely enough for most students to grasp.2 Other international macroeconomics textbooks are no better in this respect, and usually a lot worse.3\nThe role of the long-run outcome in anchoring expectations is also my reason to discuss the long run before the short run. It would be essentially impossible to do short-run analysis without some notion of how expectations are formed, and the formation of expectations would be impossible to explain without a discussion of long-run equilibrium.\nThese lecture notes are a work in progress.

    "text": "On these issues, see Rødseth (2000). By perfect capital mobility I mean a world in which (a) people who buy assets care only about the expected returns of those assets, and (b) they all have the same expectations about future changes in exchange rates. See section XXX.↩︎\nOn page 442 of Krugman, Obstfeld, and Melitz (2022) the authors address the issue as follows: “A permanent policy shift affects not only the current value of the government’s policy instrument (the money supply, government spending, or taxes) but also the long-run exchange rate. This in turn affects expectations about future exchange rates. Because these changes in expectations have a major influence on the exchange rate prevailing in the short run, the effects of permanent policy shifts differ from those of temporary shifts.”↩︎\nConsider Feenstra and Taylor (2008). On page 551 of their excellent textbook, the authors write, “[W]e can form expectations of the future exchange rate using the long-run monetary approach …” This easy-to-miss mention of the idea that expectations are based on the long-run equilibrium outcome is not adequately developed, as far as I am concerned. And the consequent need to distinguish between temporary and permanent policy changes is not as clearly developed as I would like.↩︎",

This fact of life, which economists call scarcity, makes it important for us to know how the many economic variables that are important to us—such as the gross domestic product, the unemployment rate, the consumer price index, etc.—can be made to increase or decrease as needed. For example, scarcity makes it important to understand whether our gross domestic product would increase or decrease if we imposed tariffs on imported goods.\nEconomics consists of:",

    "section": "1.4 Why Study International Macroeconomics?",
    "text": "1.4 Why Study International Macroeconomics?\nThe point of studying international macroeconomics is to be able to evaluate alternative macroeconomic policies and choose the one that’s best. If we have a reliable theory that explains the reasons why a certain variable goes up or down, we might be able to figure out policies that will move that variable in the desired direction. For example, if we can figure out the reasons for the up and down movements of a nation’s trade deficit, we might be able to design economic policies that drive the trade deficit in the desired direction, be it up or down.\nIn discussing macroeconomic policy I will focus on fiscal policy and monetary policy.\n\n1.4.1 What Is Fiscal Policy?\nFiscal policy consists of all the methods of controlling an economy by making changes to the government’s budget. A government’s budget is a description of its spending and revenue-raising plans. So, for my purposes, fiscal policy essentially consists of changes in total government spending, \\(G\\), and total tax revenue, \\(T\\).1\nSecond, to be more precise, \\(T\\) represents total net tax revenue, which equals the tax revenues of the government less transfer payments made by the government. Transfer payments are gifts, such as cash grants to the poor.\nThird, \\(G\\) represents government purchases rather than government spending. The latter includes the former plus transfer payments, which, as I said in the previous paragraph, are gifts, not payments made for purchases. \\(G\\) represents only what the government spends for its purchases of goods and services.\n\n\n1.4.2 What Is Monetary Policy?\nMonetary policy consists of all the methods of controlling an economy by making changes to the economic variables that are directly controlled by the country’s monetary authorities, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States. For my purposes, monetary policy consists of changes in a country’s money supply, \\(M\\). A central bank may print money and lend it to financial institutions such as banks. If and when these financial institutions in turn lend the money to people or to businesses, the newly printed money begins to affect actual economic activity. This, of course, is why the central bank printed the money in the first place. \n\n\n1.4.3 Monetary Unions\nIn the case of the 24 European countries that all use the same currency, the euro, there is no monetary policy at all to conduct!2 These countries have willingly given up their individual currencies and formed a monetary union. The monetary policy of the entire eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.3\nIt is important to understand the pros and cons of the formation of a monetary union so that countries considering joining a monetary union may make smart choices.\nJust as multiple countries may choose to use a common currency, they may also choose to adopt a common fiscal policy whereby a central budget sets expenditure and revenue-raising rules for all members of the club. For example, the USA may be thought of as a union of fifty states with a common currency and a unified fiscal policy decided in Washington, D.C. In fact, we will see that it may be difficult for a group of countries to share a common currency and retain independent national fiscal policies. During the economic crises that cascaded through several eurozone countries—such as Ireland, Greece, and Spain—during 2009–2012, some commentators argued that the eurozone countries needed to unify their budgets—and become something like a United States of Europe—if they were to have a stable monetary union.\nIn any case, countries considering a monetary and/or fiscal union need to be able to make their choices with their eyes wide open. It is, therefore, necessary for international economics to have something useful to say on the issue.",

    "section": "2.2 Nominal Gross Domestic Product",
    "text": "2.2 Nominal Gross Domestic Product\n\nThere are three equivalent ways of understanding nominal gross domestic product: the value-added approach, the income approach, and the expenditure approach.\n\n2.2.1 GDP: The Value-Added Approach\nThe value added by a firm is the monetary market value of the goods and services produced by the firm minus the monetary market value of the goods and services that the firm purchases from other firms (for use in its own production, obviously). A country’s gross domestic product is then the total value added—during a specified time period, such as a year—by all producers of for-sale goods located within the country.\nConsider a university. Let’s say that the market value of the educational services provided by this university was $20 m during 2008, as measured by the tuition paid by its students. It would be incorrect, however, to say that the market value of the work done in the university was $20 m. The university used a lot of electricity that was produced by some other firm. The university bought massive amounts of paper, computer printer cartridges, and other stationery from other firms. The university’s capital equipment (which includes its buildings, its computers, its fleet of cars and trucks, etc.) needed costly replacements that had to be bought from other firms. Suppose the monetary market value of these and all other goods and services that were purchased from other firms and used by the university’s employees during 2008 was $16 m. Then the value added by the university was only $20 m – $16 m = $4 m.\nAnd, as we saw two paragraphs back, the total value added by all producers of for-sale goods and services located within a country’s borders is that country’s gross domestic product.\n\n\n2.2.2 GDP: The Income Approach\nNow, returning to our hypothetical university, a question arises: What happens to the $4 m that the university has left of its $20 m tuition revenues after paying $16 m to other firms for its various purchases? Where will this $4 m go?\nA big chunk will go to pay wages to the university’s employees. The university will have to pay rent on some property that it had leased from others. It will have to pay interest to its banks for the loans it had taken. It will have to pay what are called indirect business taxes to the government. And whatever remains will be the university’s profits, which belong to the university’s owners or shareholders. In other words, the university’s value added ends up as the income of the owners of the resources employed by the university.\nWhat’s true for this university is true for all firms in the country. Therefore, as a country’s gross domestic product is its total value added, one can say that a country’s gross domestic product is the total income earned by the owners of all the resources employed by producers located within the country’s borders.\n\n\n2.2.3 GDP: The Expenditure Approach\nLet us consider our hypothetical university one more time. The education it provides its students is an example of a final good.1 A good is called a final good when it is sold to its final user; a final user is someone who will not use the purchased good to produce something else for sale.\nThe electricity, paper, other stationery, etc., that the university buys for the purpose of producing educational services are called intermediate goods. When goods are bought by businesses from other businesses, used as inputs in the production of other for-sale goods, and, in the process, end up disappearing completely inside those other goods, they are called intermediate goods. (Think of all the milk produced by U.S. dairy farmers that disappear into the ice cream made by U.S. firms such as Ben & Jerry’s.)\nIn my example, students paid $20 m for education, the final good produced by the university. As we saw in section Section 2.2.2 above, this money ends up as the incomes of all the resources—employed by the university and by the firms from which the university bought electricity, paper, and all sorts of other intermediate goods—that were used to produce the final good, education.\nExtrapolating from this example, we can say that the total expenditure on all final goods produced domestically and sold to domestic final users—let’s call these goods category \\(a\\) goods—is equal to the income earned by all resources employed in the production of these final goods and the intermediate goods used in the production of these final goods.\nMoreover, what’s true for education must also be true for the domestic production of all exported goods—let’s call these category \\(b\\) goods. The total expenditure on these goods must end up as the total income of all resources used to make these goods and the intermediate goods bought by the producers of these goods.\nTherefore, the total expenditure on the goods in categories \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) minus the value of the intermediate goods imported by the producers of category \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) goods is the total income of all resources that were used to make category \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) goods and the domestically produced intermediate goods bought by their producers.\nBut this income must be the total income of all resources employed in domestic production. After all, any domestic producer would have to produce either final goods sold to domestic buyers (category \\(a\\)), or exported goods (category \\(b\\)), or the domestically produced intermediate goods bought by category \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) producers.\nTherefore, going by the definition of GDP in Section 2.2.2, the total expenditure on category \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) goods minus imports of intermediate goods equals gross domestic product.\nIn publications of government statistics, the total expenditure by households residing within a country is called personal consumption expenditure or, simply, consumption. The total spending on final goods by domestic businesses is called gross private domestic investment or, simply, investment. Total spending by domestic government entities is called government expenditure. Therefore, total expenditure on all final goods by domestic residents is consumption \\(+\\) investment \\(+\\) government spending. Consequently, total expenditure on final goods produced domestically and sold to domestic residents—category \\(a\\)—is consumption \\(+\\) investment \\(+\\) government spending \\(-\\) imports of final goods. Therefore, the total expenditure on goods in categories \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) equals consumption \\(+\\) investment \\(+\\) government spending \\(+\\) exports \\(-\\) imports of final goods. Therefore, recalling the last sentence of the previous paragraph, gross domestic product equals consumption \\(+\\) investment \\(+\\) government spending \\(+\\) exports \\(-\\) imports of final goods \\(-\\) imports of intermediate goods. Consequently, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{GDP}=\\text{Consumption}+\\text{Investment}+\\text{Government Purchases}+\\text{Exports}-\\text{Imports}.\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nThis is easily the most important equation in this book. It is called the national income identity and will be central to our discussion right up to the very end of this book.\nNote that it is not terribly meaningful to distinguish between exports of final goods and exports of intermediate goods. And the same can be said about imports too. Nevertheless, if we simplify a bit and assume that all exports and imports are of final goods, Equation 2.1 can be interpreted as follows: a country’s gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services produced within the country in a given period of time (usually a year). This is a very popular definition that you will see in many textbooks. I will use this definition in this book too, as a convenient shorthand.\n\n\n2.2.4 GDP: Overview\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Nominal GDP is from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPA, in billions of current dollars.

This means that spending by US residents on the final goods and services that were “Made in USA” in 2014 plus net exports of “Made in USA” goods and services were together equal to a grand total of $17608.14 billion. This number is also the total value added by all producers located in the USA. And—perhaps most meaningfully—this number is the total income earned by all productive resources employed by producers located in the USA.",

    "section": "2.3 Real Gross Domestic Product",
    "text": "2.3 Real Gross Domestic Product\n\nLooking at the second column in Table 2.1, we see that the nominal gross domestic product of the United States increased from $17608.14 billion in 2014 to $18295.02 billion in 2015 and to $18804.91 billion in 2016. If one assumes that our quality of life depends crucially on the goods and services we produce, these ever increasing dollar figures seem like good news.\nBut are they?\nAs nominal gross domestic product is the monetary market value of all final goods produced, it could increase from one year to the next either as a result of:\n\nincreases in the production of various goods, or\nincreases in the market prices of those goods, or\nincreases in both production and prices.\n\nConsequently, increases in nominal gross domestic product do not necessarily imply increases in production. Mere inflation could make the numbers go up and up.\nNow if, by sheer luck, all prices remained unchanged during 2014 – 2016, then, yes, the increases in nominal GDP during that period would indeed strongly indicate rising overall levels of production.2\nOf course, in real life, prices do not stay unchanged year after year. But even if prices moved around a lot during 2014 – 2016, we could still ask a hypothetical question: What would nominal GDP have been during 2014 – 2016 if prices had remained unchanged at 2014 levels? This is not an unanswerable question. We know the 2014 prices of all final goods, and we know the quantities produced, of all final goods, during the years 2014, 2015 and 2016. (Otherwise, we would not have been able to calculate the nominal GDP figures in Table 2.1.) Therefore, we can easily calculate what America’s nominal GDP would have been in those years, had the prices of 2014 prevailed in all years.\nIndeed, data on this hypothetical measure—formally called real gross domestic product or constant-prices gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted gross domestic product—is available for virtually every country in the world. The third column of Table 2.1 shows America’s real gross domestic product, calculated on the assumption that the prices of the year 2017 prevailed in all years, for the decade 2014– 2023.3\nAs you can see, not only did America’s nominal GDP increase throughout 2014– 2023, so did real GDP. This is clear evidence of actual increases in production. To repeat, the dollar figures in the third column of Table 2.1 were all calculated on the hypothetical assumption that 2017’s prices prevailed in every year. As the same prices were used for every year’s real GDP calculations, the increases in real GDP strongly indicate overall increases in production.\nThe year whose prices are being assumed hypothetically to prevail in all years—the year 2017 in this case—is called the base year. There is nothing sacrosanct about the year 2017—any other year could have served just as well. As long as every year’s GDP is calculated using the same set of prices, we will get a measure of GDP that is not affected by fluctuations in the overall level of prices.\nIn the rest of this book, all references to gross domestic product are references to real gross domestic product. Also, I will use the symbol \\(Y\\) to denote real gross domestic product.\n\n2.3.1 Notation: Growth Rates\nConsider a variable \\(x\\). I will denote its current value as simply \\(x\\) and its past value as \\(x_{-1}\\). Then, the growth rate of \\(x\\), which I will denote \\(x_g\\), can be defined as follows: \\[\nx_g\\equiv\\frac{x-x_{-1}}{x_{-1}}.\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nHere, \\(x-x_{-1}\\) represents the increase in the value of \\(x\\). Therefore, \\((x-x_{-1})/x_{-1}\\) is the proportionate increase in the value of \\(x\\) or, simply, the growth rate of \\(x\\). If \\(x_{-1}=50\\) and \\(x=60\\), the increase is \\(x-x_{-1}=60-50=10\\). But the rate of growth is \\(x_g\\equiv(x-x_{-1})/x_{-1}=(60-50)/50=0.20\\).\nIf you want the growth rate as a percentage, simply multiply \\(x_g\\) by 100 to get \\(0.20\\times100=20\\) percent.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: The base year is 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSA, 2014 -- 2023\n\n\nYear\nGrowth, Nominal GDP (%)\nGrowth, Real GDP (%)\nInflation (%)\n\n\n\n\n2014\n4.31\n2.52\n1.74\n\n\n2015\n3.90\n2.95\n0.93\n\n\n2016\n2.79\n1.82\n0.95\n\n\n2017\n4.29\n2.46\n1.79\n\n\n2018\n5.33\n2.97\n2.29\n\n\n2019\n4.28\n2.58\n1.65\n\n\n2020\n−0.86\n−2.16\n1.33\n\n\n2021\n10.90\n6.06\n4.57\n\n\n2022\n9.82\n2.51\n7.13\n\n\n2023\n6.59\n2.89\n3.60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo take a more concrete example, consider real gross domestic product (\\(Y\\)) and its growth rate (\\(Y_g\\)). Table 2.1 tells us that real GDP of the U.S. (in billions of chained 2017 dollars), was $18261.71 in 2014 and $18799.62 in 2015. Therefore, the growth rate of America’s real GDP in 2015 was \\[\nY_{g,2015}=\\frac{Y_{2015}-Y_{2014}}{Y_{2014}} = \\frac{18799.62-18261.71}{18261.71}\\times 100 = 2.95\n\\] percent.

    "text": "2.4 The Components of GDP\nNow that we have discussed the measurement of a country’s total production, let us look at what happens to it. Government statisticians typically publish data not only on a country’s output of final goods and services (that is, its GDP) but also on who bought those final goods and services. As in Figure 2.1, national income data usually breaks down the big GDP number into four smaller numbers that represent the final-goods purchases made by four major categories of buyers:\n\npersonal consumption expenditures (\\(C\\)),\ngross private domestic investment (\\(I\\)),\ngovernment purchases (\\(G\\)), and\nnet exports of goods and services (\\(NX\\)).\n\nIn other words, Equation 2.1, which is called the national income identity and breaks down nominal gross domestic product into its components, is equally true for real gross domestic product: \\[\nY=C+I+G+NX.\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\n\n2.4.1 Consumption\n\nThe real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) personal consumption expenditures of the residents of a country in a given year is denoted by the symbol \\(C\\). In U.S. data, \\(C\\) consists of spending by households on all final goods except newly built homes. As you can see from the U.S. data in Figure 2.2, \\(C\\) is a very large part—more than two-thirds—of GDP.\n\n\n2.4.2 Investment\n\nThe real gross private domestic investment (or, simply, investment) of a country is denoted by the symbol \\(I\\). In U.S. data, \\(I\\) consists of:\n\nthe purchases of fixed assets (equipment, software, and buildings) by businesses for use in production,\nthe purchases of new homes by households,4 and\nincreases in inventories of unsold goods held by businesses.\n\nNote that the inclusion of these three categories of final goods under investment is not random. There is an underlying theme here: machines, new buildings, stocks of as-yet-unsold goods, etc., all contribute to our future welfare.5 The money we spend on pizzas and backrubs, by contrast, are all about the here and now and are included under consumption, \\(C\\).\nAs you can see from the U.S. data in Figure 2.2, \\(I\\), at less than 15% of GDP, is a lot less important than \\(C\\). And yet, because of its tendency to fluctuate wildly, investment spending is an important cause of the ups and downs of the overall economy.\n\n2.4.2.1 Inventories\n\nThe inclusion of increases in businesses’ stocks of unsold goods in \\(I\\) needs some justification. What’s the point of including this in \\(I\\)?\nKeep in mind that to get an accurate picture of the health of an economy in a given year we need to count the market value of all goods and services produced during the year, whether or not they are sold by December 31st of that year. Those unsold goods would not be counted in \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(NX\\), if these four variables included only the actual purchases of final goods by households, businesses, the government, and foreign buyers. To make sure that all goods produced in 2008 get counted in that year’s GDP—even if they are not sold in 2008—statisticians include the additions of unsold goods to businesses’ inventories (or, warehouse stocks) in \\(I\\).\nNote that I did not say that additions to businesses’ inventories of unsold final goods are included in \\(I\\); even the intermediate goods that were produced in 2008 but not sold by the end of that year need to be counted in that year’s GDP.\nSure, as the ice cream made by Ben & Jerry’s is counted in GDP, one should not separately count the milk that went into it because the monetary market value of the ice cream already includes the monetary market value of the milk. But let’s complicate the story a little. Suppose Ben & Jerry’s buys $10 million of freshly produced milk some time in 2008, but does not turn it into ice cream by December 31, 2008. Instead, the milk is sitting in their freezer on that last day of 2008, waiting to be turned into Cherry Garcia some time in 2009. This $10 million worth of milk was produced in 2008 and, therefore, should be included in 2008’s GDP. To ensure this, the rules of GDP accounting require that any goods that have been added to the inventories (or, warehouse stocks of goods) of private businesses during 2008 are final goods and their value must be counted in the GDP for 2008.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Government Spending\n\nReal government expenditures (\\(G\\)) is pretty much what it sounds like; it is the inflation-adjusted monetary value of all final goods and services bought by government entities.\nTypically, governments also spend huge amounts of money on transfer payments or, loosely speaking, gifts (usually to needy people). But \\(G\\) includes only the money spent on the purchase of final goods and does not include transfer payments.\n\n\n2.4.4 Net Exports\n\nReal exports of goods and services (\\(EX\\)) is the inflation-adjusted value of all domestically produced goods that are bought by foreigners.\nReal imports of goods and services (\\(IM\\)) is the inflation-adjusted value of all foreign-made goods that are bought by domestic residents.\nReal net exports (\\(NX\\)) is then defined as \\(NX\\equiv EX-IM\\). This also goes by other names, such as trade surplus, balance on goods and services, and, somewhat loosely, balance on the current account—see Equation 3.1. Note, therefore, that \\(NX\\) could be positive, zero or negative. When \\(NX\\) is positive/zero/negative, the country is said to have a Trade Surplus/Balanced Trade/a Trade Deficit.\n\n2.4.4.1 All exports and imports are final!\nThere’s one more loose end in my definition of GDP that I need to tie up. Note that in Section 2.4.4 above I defined exports as “all domestically produced goods that are bought by foreigners”, not all domestically produced final goods”. Similarly, note that I defined imports as “all foreign-made goods that are bought by domestic residents”, not all foreign-made final goods”. Why am I including exports and imports of intermediate goods? Suppose that American dairy farmers produce $10 million of milk in 2008 and sell it to a Canadian ice cream company that turns the milk into ice cream in its plant in Vancouver, also in 2008. The monetary value of the ice cream would not be counted in America’s GDP because the ice cream was made in Canada. So, if the $10 million of milk is regarded as an intermediate good, it would not be counted at all in America’s GDP. When the milk is turned into ice cream by Ben & Jerry’s, the ice cream is counted in America’s GDP and, therefore, so is the milk, although indirectly. But as for the milk that is sold to a Canadian ice cream company, the only way to have it counted in America’s GDP is to require that anything sold to foreigners is counted in \\(EX\\). Similarly, it is straightforward to show that imports of intermediate goods should be counted in the importing country’s \\(IM\\).\nSo, here’s the final corrected version—fingers crossed!—of the definition of gross domestic product: GDP is the monetary market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year plus the increase in its inventories of intermediate goods plus its net exports of intermediate goods.",

    "section": "2.5 The National Income Identity",
    "text": "2.5 The National Income Identity\nTo recap, we have so far defined real gross domestic product (\\(Y\\)), real personal consumption expenditure (\\(C\\)), real gross private domestic investment (\\(I\\)), real government spending (\\(G\\)), and real exports (\\(EX\\)). It is tempting to argue that \\(Y\\) must be equal to \\(C+I+G+EX\\). After all, \\(Y\\) represents all final goods that are “Made in USA” and any such good would have to be bought either by American households (\\(C\\)), or by American businesses (\\(I\\)), or by America’s government (\\(G\\)), or by foreigners (\\(EX\\)). Therefore, \\(Y\\) should be equal to \\(C+I+G+EX\\), right?\nWell, not exactly. Although \\(C+I+G\\), which incidentally is referred to as gross domestic purchases, does represent the total purchases by domestic households, businesses, and government entities, it includes purchases of imported goods as well as domestically produced goods. Therefore, only if we subtract the inflation-adjusted monetary value of all imported goods (denoted by the symbol \\(IM\\)) from \\(C+I+G+EX\\) would we get \\(Y\\). That is, \\(Y=C+I+G+EX-IM\\).\nAs we saw in Section 2.4.4, the terms net exports, trade surplus, and balance on goods and services all refer to \\(NX\\equiv EX-IM\\), the excess of exports over imports. Therefore, we get the national income identity: \\[\nY=C+I+G+NX.\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nThis is a reappearance of Equation 2.1 and Equation 2.4.\nFigure 2.1 shows data on real gross domestic product and its components for the United States for the years 2005–8. You can check that \\(C+I+G+NX\\) is indeed equal to real GDP.\nA theoretically equivalent measure is gross domestic income. When government statisticians measure the total value added by domestic producers, they measure the gross domestic product (GDP). When they measure the total income of all resources employed by domestic producers, they measure gross domestic income (GDI). As we have seen above, if measured with perfect accuracy, these two magnitudes should be the same, as they are theoretically equivalent. In practice, however, errors do creep in, and the GDP and GDI numbers tend to differ. This difference is called the statistical discrepancy: \\(GDP=GDI+\\text{statistical discrepancy}\\).\n\n2.5.1 Beyond GDP: Other Measures of Total Production\nGross domestic product is not the only measure of a country’s total production, there are others.\n\n2.5.1.1 Gross National Product\n\nRecall that a country’s gross domestic product is not only the total value added by all producers located within the country, it is also equal to gross domestic income, which is the total income earned by the factors of production (or, in plain language, resources) employed by all producers located within the country.6\nSome of the resources employed by producers located within the country may be owned by foreign residents, and the income paid to these resources goes, necessarily, to their foreign owners. Conversely, some residents of the domestic country may earn income for work done for producers located in foreign countries. A country’s net factor income earned from foreign residents (\\(NIF\\)) equals total income earned by domestic residents from foreign residents minus total income paid by domestic residents to foreign residents.\nAs, in some cases, it is important to know the total income earned by the factors of production owned by a country’s residents, we often pay attention to a country’s gross national product (GNP): \\[\n\\text{GNP}=\\text{GDP}+\\text{NIF}.\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nA theoretically equivalent measure is gross national income: \\(GNI=GDI+NIF\\). Recall from Section 2.5 that although GDP and GDI are theoretically the same, and would be equal if accurately measure, in practice the measured magnitudes differ slightly: \\(GDP=GDI+\\text{statistical discrepancy}\\). The same distinction needs to be made between GNP and GNI as well; they’d be equal if measured accurately, but in practice \\(GNP=GNI+\\text{statistical discrepancy}\\).\n\n\n2.5.1.2 Gross National Disposable Income\n\nThe residents of a country may send gifts to—and receive gifts from—the residents of other countries. A country’s net unilateral transfers of income from foreign residents (NUT) is defined as gifts received minus gifts given. Gross national disposable income (GNDI) is then defined as \\[\n\\text{GNDI}=\\text{GNI}+\\text{NUT}.\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nRecall that gross domestic product is denoted by the symbol \\(Y\\). In practice, the statistical discrepancy between GDP and GDI (or between GNP and GNI) is small. Moreover, net factor income earned from foreign residents (NIF) and net unilateral transfers of income from foreign residents (NUT) tend to be small too. As a result, the differences between GDP, GDI, GNP, GNI, and GNDI are, for most practical purposes, small enough to be ignored. Consequently, to keep the discussion simple, I will use the symbol \\(Y\\) to refer to all these different ways of measuring a country’s total value added, total income, and total expenditure.\n\n\n2.5.1.3 National Income Identity, Revisited\n\nRecall from Equation 2.5 that \\[ Y=C+I+G+NX.\\] Therefore, \\[Y+\\text{NIF}+\\text{NUT}=C+I+G+NX+\\text{NIF}+\\text{NUT}.\\] It is clear from equations Equation 2.6 and Equation 2.7, the last equation can be re-written as \\[\n\\text{GNDI}=C+I+G+(NX+\\text{NIF}+\\text{NUT}).\n\\]\nAs we will see in the next chapter’s discussion of balance of payments accounting, the expression within parentheses in the last equation is called the balance on the current account or, simply the current account (CA). The equation above then yields a slightly updated version of the national income identity: \\[\n\\text{GNDI}=C+I+G+CA.\n\\tag{2.8}\\]\nThe reader should be warned, however, that I will use the terms net exports (\\(NX\\)) and current account balance (\\(CA=NX+NIF+NUT\\)) interchangeably throughout this book, because—as was pointed out a short while back in Section 2.5.1.2—both \\(NIF\\) and \\(NUT\\) tend to be small in magnitude.",

    "section": "2.6 Prices and Inflation",
    "text": "2.6 Prices and Inflation\nInflation is a topic of major concern in economics as well as in our daily lives. Therefore, it is important to understand what causes it and how it can be controlled. But before we can get to that, we need to discuss how inflation is measured.\nThe measurement of inflation can be quite tricky. While the prices of some goods may rise from one year to the next, the prices of other goods may fall. In such cases, one needs to come up with one number that summarizes the overall change in prices.\n\n2.6.1 The Implicit Price Deflator for GDP\n\nSuppose you recently spent a day in Boston followed by a day in San Antonio. You ate the same meals in both cities, bought the same newspaper, rented the same type of car, and stayed in identical hotels. Nevertheless, you ended up spending 10% more in Boston. Why? You did not buy more stuff in Boston; in fact, you bought exactly the same things in both cities. Therefore, the only explanation is that prices were higher overall in Boston. Some things may be cheaper in Boston and some other things may be cheaper in San Antonio. But it is reasonable to conclude—from your own limited experience in the two cities—that the overall level of prices was 10% higher in Boston relative to San Antonio.\nNow consider another hypothetical example. Suppose you spent both October 1, 2005 and October 1, 2006 in Boston and during both visits you bought the exact same things, used the same transportation, and stayed in identical hotel rooms. And yet, you ended up spending 4% more in 2006 than in 2005. Using the same logic as in the last paragraph, we can conclude that although individual items’ prices may have changed at different rates, the overall level of prices in Boston rose 4% in 2006 relative to 2005.\nIn fact, you don’t even have to visit Boston on two different dates. After your October 1, 2006 visit, you could dig up data on the prices that you would have paid if you had visited Boston a year earlier and bought the same goods and services that you bought during your October 1, 2006 visit, and you would have again reached the conclusion that the overall level of prices rose 4% in Boston in 2006. And that, by and large, is what government statisticians do to measure the rates of change of the overall level of prices in the US and other countries.\nOne way to measure the overall level of prices is to compare the nominal GDP and the real GDP for a particular year. We see in Table 2.1 that in 1999 America’s nominal GDP was $9,353.5 billion and America’s real GDP, with base year 2005, was $10,779.8 billion. Stated differently, in 1999 America’s nominal GDP was 86.8% of America’s real GDP: \\[\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP in 1999}}{\\text{Real GDP in 1999 with base year 2005}}\\times 100&=&\\frac{9,353.5}{10,779.8}\\times 100\\\\\n&=& 86.8.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\] So, at 1999 prices, the dollar value of all final goods produced in the U.S. in 1999 was $9,353.5 billion, whereas, at 2005 prices, the dollar value of the exact same goods was $10,779.8 billion.\nNow, how could one dollar value of the final goods made in 1999 be different from the other dollar value of the exact same goods? As the quantities used in the nominal GDP calculation are the same as the quantities used in the real GDP calculation, these two dollar values must be different because they use different prices.\nMore precisely, the only possible reason why America’s nominal GDP in 1999 is 86.8% of America’s real GDP in 1999 must be that the prices that prevailed in 1999, which are the ones that were used in the calculation of nominal GDP, were, in an overall sense, 86.8% as high as the prices that had prevailed in 2005, which are the ones that were used in the calculation of real GDP.\nIt would be incorrect to conclude that all final goods were 86.8% as pricey in 1999 as in 2005. For apples, the 1999 price may have been 80% of the 2005 price. For haircuts, the 1999 price may have been 130% of the 2005 price. For gas at the pump, the 1999 price may have been 99% of the 2005 price. But it is reasonable to say that in an overall sense the 1999 prices were 86.8% as high as the 2005 prices because the final goods that were produced in America in 1999 were only 86.8% as valuable at 1999 prices than at 2005 prices.\nThus, by comparing the nominal and real GDP values for a particular year we are able to measure how that year’s prices as a whole measure up relative to the base year’s prices. Formally, the\n\\[\n\\text{Implicit Price Deflator for GDP in year $n$ with base year $m$} = \\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP in year $n$}}{\\text{Real GDP in year $n$ with base year $m$}}\\times 100\n\\tag{2.9}\\] shows what the overall level of final goods’ prices in year \\(n\\) was as a percentage of the base year’s overall price level. More compactly, \\[\n\\text{Implicit Price Deflator}=\n\\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}}{\\text{Real GDP}}\\times 100.\n\\tag{2.10}\\]\nThe fourth column in Table 2.1 shows America’s implicit price deflator for GDP (IPDGDP) for the 1999–2008 decade. Specifically, it shows that the overall level of prices in 1999 was 86.8% of the overall level of prices in 2005. Similarly, the overall level of prices in 2005 was 100% of the overall level of prices in 2005—what a shocker!—and the overall price level in 2007 was 106.2% of the overall level of prices in 2005.7\nIn the remainder of these lectures, I will represent the overall price level for a particular year not by the implicit price deflator for GDP but by a very slightly different version of it: \\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nP&=&\\frac{\\text{Implicit Price Deflator for GDP}}{100}\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}}{\\text{Real GDP}}\\times\\frac{100}{100}\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}}{Y}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{2.11}\\] Note that Equation 2.11 comes from equation Equation 2.9.\nIn other words, while real GDP is represented by the symbol \\(Y\\), the overall level of prices is denoted by the symbol \\(P\\), and nominal GDP is given by \\[\n\\text{Nominal GDP}=P\\times Y.\n\\tag{2.12}\\]\n\n\n2.6.2 The Consumer Price Index\n\nThe implicit price deflator for GDP is not the only one-number representation of the overall level of the prices of the innumerable goods that are bought and sold in a modern economy. Indeed, it may not even be the most popular method: a frequently cited alternative measure of the overall level of prices is the consumer price index.\nWhereas the implicit price deflator for GDP is (100 times) the value of the current year’s output of final goods at the current year’s prices divided by the value of the same set of goods at the base year’s prices, the consumer price index is (100 times) the value of a fixed bundle of goods that represents the purchases of a typical consumer* at the current year’s prices divided by the value of that same bundle of goods at the base year’s prices.\nAlthough Equation 2.11 sees the overall price level, \\(P\\), as the implicit deflator for GDP divided by 100, you may, if you wish, think of \\(P\\) as the consumer price index divided by 100. In practical terms, these two measures of the overall price level tend to move in sync most of the time.8\n\n\n2.6.3 Inflation\n\nFinally, how do we measure inflation? Inflation is defined simply as the growth rate of the overall level of prices, where the term ‘growth rate’ is as it is defined in Section 2.3.1. I will denote inflation by the symbol \\(\\pi\\), which is the lower-case Greek letter ‘pi’. Denoting the past value of the overall price level by the symbol \\(P_{-1}\\), we can use equation Equation 2.2 to express inflation as follows: \\[\n\\pi\\equiv\\frac{P-P_{-1}}{P_{-1}}\\equiv\\frac{P}{P_{-1}}-1.\n\\tag{2.13}\\] The increase in the overall price level is \\(P-P_{-1}\\). But the proportionate increase in \\(P\\) is \\((P-P_{-1})/P_{-1}\\). And to express inflation as a percentage, one has to multiply \\(\\pi\\) by 100.\nFor example, the annual inflation rate for, say, 2004 is \\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\text{Inflation during 2004}}\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\\frac{P_{2004}-P_{2003}}{P_{2003}}\\times 100\\\\\n&=&\\frac{\\text{IPDGDP}_{2004}-\\text{IPDGDP}_{2003}}{\\text{IPDGDP}_{2003}}\\times 100\\\\\n&=&\\frac{96.77-94.1}{94.1}\\times 100\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&2.8 \\text{ percent}.\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{2.14}\\]\nAmerica’s annual inflation rates, as defined above, are shown in Table 2.2 for 1999–2008. Although these inflation numbers are calculated based on the implicit price deflator for GDP as the price level, one could also think of inflation as the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index, which has been discussed above in Section 2.6.2. In practical terms, this does not make much difference to inflation data, especially over longer periods, as you can see in Figure 2.3. Over short periods of time, however, inflation measures based on the consumer price index are more volatile, as can be seen in Figure 2.4}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Inflation: Two Measures The red graph represents US inflation measured by the year-on-year percentage change in the implicit price deflator for GDP. The blue graph uses the consumer price index (for all urban consumers) instead.

    "text": "3.3 The Financial Account\nTransactions in which assets are traded between residents of America and residents of other countries are summarized in America’s financial account.\nAn asset is pretty much anything that you can buy today (if you have some surplus cash) and sell later (if you need some extra cash). If your asset provides some service to someone while you are its owner, you can earn an income from your asset. For example, if an American buys a house in Germany, she would be buying an asset. And the rental income she earns by renting out the house is her asset income. If an American buys a German company’s stock, she would be buying an asset. And the dividend income she earns (as long as she owns the stock) is her asset income. If an American puts money in a German bank, that bank account is an asset that will periodically yield interest income.\nInterestingly, while international asset trades are recorded in the financial account of a nation’s balance of payments, the income earned from those assets are considered to be payments for services rendered by the assets and are, therefore, recorded in the current account. So, an American’s purchase of a house in Germany will be recorded in the financial account and any subsequent rental income from that house will be recorded in the current account.\nThe financial account includes the Official Reserve Transactions Account. Most countries have central banks that design and carry out their monetary policies. For example, America’s central bank is the Federal Reserve (or, simply, the Fed). Central banks often buy and/or sell assets. For example, the Bank of Japan (i.e., Japan’s central bank) may buy U.S. Treasury bonds. It may then sell those bonds at a later date if it needs dollars. The assets that central banks typically buy and sell are called reserve assets. International trade in reserve assets conducted by central banks is recorded in the official reserve transactions account.",

Any transaction resulting in a receipt of money from foreigners is entered in the balance of payments accounts as a credit and is given a positive (\\(+\\)) sign. In other words, any transaction in which we sell (i.e., export) goods, services or assets to foreigners is recorded as a credit.\n\n\n3.4.2 Which Transactions Are Recorded as Debits?\nAny transaction in which we pay money to foreigners is entered in the balance of payments accounts as a debit and is given a negative (\\(-\\)) sign.

    "section": "3.5 Accounting Rules: Examples",
    "text": "3.5 Accounting Rules: Examples\nHere are some examples that illustrate the rules of balance of payments accounting that I have discussed above:\n\nThe sale (i.e., export) of a U.S. car to Germany is a credit in the U.S. current account.\nAn American’s purchase (i.e., import) of a house in Germany is a debit in America’s capital account.\nThe rental income earned by an American from her house in Germany is seen as the export of housing services from America to Germany and is, therefore, a credit in America’s current account.\nWhen a German deposits some extra cash in his New York bank account, it is seen as the purchase by the German (and, therefore, an export by America) of an American asset (in this case, the increased value of the bank account) and is recorded as a credit in America’s financial account.\n\nNote again that credits are always exports of goods, services or assets and debits are always imports.\n\n3.5.1 What Is the Balance on an Account?\nThe total of all credits minus the total of all debits in an account or sub-account is called its balance. The balance could be positive, zero, or negative.\nSince credits are exports and debits are imports, \\[\n\\text{Balance} = \\text{Credits} - \\text{Debits} = \\text{Exports} - \\text{Imports} = \\text{Net Exports}.\n\\tag{3.1}\\] In particular, our current account balance is our net export of goods and services and our financial account balance is our net export of assets.\nMost internationally traded assets are paper assets such as stocks and bonds. Unlike the purchase of, say, a house, the purchase of a stock or a bond does not involve the exchange of some tangible commodity. The purchase of stocks and bonds simply entitle the buyer to future income. If you buy Microsoft stock, Microsoft will get your money today and you will receive a share of Microsoft’s future profits (as long as you keep the stock). If you buy a bond from AT&T, AT&T will get your money today and you will get regular future payments of some amount specified on the bond. Notice that in both of these last two cases, what you are really doing is lending some of your money to others today in the expectation that they will pay you in the future. When you buy Microsoft stock, you are lending money to Microsoft. When you buy AT&T bonds, you are lending money to AT&T. Similarly, the sale of stocks (by, say, Microsoft) and bonds (by, say, AT&T) is simply a way for these companies to borrow money.\nApplying this idea to international asset trades, America’s sale (or, export) of stocks and bonds to foreigners during 1999 is equal to the amount America borrowed from foreigners during 1999 and America’s purchase (or, import) of stocks and bonds from foreigners during 1999 is equal to the amount America loaned to foreigners during 1999. Therefore, our financial account balance for 1999 is equal to the increase in our net indebtedness to foreigners during 1999.\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\text{Financial Account Balance in 1999}}\\\\\n&=&\\text{Financial Account Credits}-\\text{Financial Account Debits}\\nonumber\\\\\n&=&\\text{Assets Exports}-\\text{Assets Imports}\\nonumber\\\\\n&=&\\text{Borrowing from foreigners in 1999}-\\text{Lending to foreigners in 1999}\\nonumber\\\\\n&=&\\text{Increase in our net indebtedness in 1999.}\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nIf, for example, our financial account balance during 1999 was +$100 billion, then we borrowed $100 billion more from foreigners than we lent them, and, so, our indebtedness to foreigners increased in 1999 by $100 billion.\nAnd, by the way, that increase of $100 billion in our foreign debt could have happened in several different ways: For example, the amount we owe them could have gone up from $500 billion to $600 billion or the amount they owe us could have gone down from $300 billion to $200 billion or their debt to us of $25 billion may have turned into our debt to them of $75 billion during 1999.\nIf, on the other hand, our financial account balance was -$150 billion, then our net indebtedness to foreigners decreased by $150 billion. Therefore, a positive financial account balance means an increase in our international indebtedness and a negative financial account balance means a decrease in our international indebtedness.",

    "section": "3.6 Balance of Payments Identity",
    "text": "3.6 Balance of Payments Identity\nNow that we have seen how the balances in the current, capital, and financial accounts are defined, it is necessary to see how the three balances are related. It turns out that the balances of the current, capital, and financial accounts must always sum to zero:\n\\[\n\\text{current account balance} + \\text{capital account balance} + \\text{financial account balance} \\equiv 0.\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nSo, if we ignore the typically tiny capital account, if the current account balance is \\(-\\)$5000, then the financial account balance would have to be +$5000, and vice versa.\nTo see the logic behind Equation 3.3, let the current account balance be \\(-\\)$5000. In other words, our net export of goods and services is \\(-\\)$5000. That is, we bought $5000 more goods and services from foreigners than we sold to them. This raises a question: How could it have happened? Are we living on the charity of foreigners? Why would they give us $5000 more stuff than we gave them? The answer is that the foreigners will let us have an additional $5000 worth of goods and services as long as we give them an additional $5000 of assets. That is, our net export of goods and services may be \\(-\\)$5000 as long as our net export of assets is \\(+\\)$5000. Therefore, recalling from Equation 3.1 that “net export” is also called “balance”, our current account balance can be \\(-\\)$5000 as long as our financial account balance is \\(+\\)$5000.\nWe saw in Section 3.5.1 that a positive financial account balance reflects an increase in our net indebtedness to foreigners. Therefore, Equation 3.3 means that we can import more goods and services than we export, as long as we understand that there will be an increase in our net indebtedness.\nAnother way to see this is to recognize that every international transaction will necessarily involve a credit in one of the two accounts—i.e., in either the current account or the financial account—and a debit of equal size in the other account.\nConsider an example. Suppose a German buys an American car for $50,000. This is a credit in the current account and, therefore, our current account balance increases by $50,000. Now, where would the German buyer get those dollars? There are several possibilities:\n\nHe has a bank account in New York from which he pays the $50,000. In this case, following example 4 in Section 3.5 above, we can see that this is a debit of $50,000 in our financial account. So, our financial account balance decreases by $50,000.\nHe sells some of his U.S. assets (such as real estate or stocks or bonds) and uses that money to buy his car. Again, a glance at examples 2 and 4 in Section 3.5 will show you that this has the same effect as in the previous case: our financial account balance decreases by $50,000.\nHe buys $50,000 from an American who needed Euros to open a bank account in Germany. As you can tell from example 4 in Section 3.5, this is a $50,000 debit in our financial account. So, again, our financial account balance decreases by $50,000.\n\nThe point of these examples is that if a transaction causes our current account balance to increase by $50,000, then it must simultaneously involve another transaction that causes our financial account balance to decrease by the same amount, irrespective of the gory details of the transaction.\nSimilarly, it can be shown that any transaction that decreases our current account balance by $40,000 will simultaneously be accompanied by other transactions that will increase our financial account balance by $40,000.\nMore generally, any transaction that changes the balance on any of these two accounts will be accompanied by other transactions that change the balance on the other account by the same amount but in the opposite direction. Hence, the current account balance plus the financial account balance must always be zero.\nIn other words—using the idea that the balance on an account is equal to the net exports on that account; see equation Equation 3.1 — the net exports of goods and services must equal the net imports of assets, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nGerber, James. 2002.

The word “nominal” is sometimes added simply to serve as a reminder that there exists another kind of exchange rate: the real exchange rate.\nIn this lecture, I will typically consider two currencies: the domestic currency and the foreign currency.

    "text": "4.2 Real Exchange Rates\nThe real exchange rate is the (average) price of foreign-made goods and services measured in units of domestically produced goods and services. It is denoted by the symbol, \\(q\\), of the lower case Greek letter “epsilon”, and it is computed by the following equation: \\[\nq=\\frac{E\\cdot P^*}{P}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nHere, \\(P\\) (respectively, \\(P^*\\)) represents the average level of prices of goods and services made in the domestic (respectively, foreign) economy. By “average level of prices” I mean some sort of price index such as the implicit price deflator for GDP or the consumer price index.2\nTo see why Equation 4.1 does measure the relative price of foreign goods in units of domestic goods, consider a world in which wheat is the only traded good. Consider “Made in USA” wheat and “Made in France” wheat. Let the price of “Made in USA” wheat be $2.00 per pound; that is, let \\(P=2\\). Let the price of “Made in France” wheat be per pound; that is, let \\(P^*=6\\). Let the price of one euro be $2.00; that is, let \\(E=2.00\\). Note that the price of “Made in France” wheat is which is worth $12.00. Note also that $12.00 would buy you six pounds of “Made in USA” wheat. Therefore, one pound of “Made in France” wheat has the same market value as six pounds of “Made in USA” wheat. That is, the real exchange rate of “Made in France” wheat is six pounds of “Made in USA” wheat. In symbols, \\(q=6\\).\nLet us now see if the formula in Equation 4.1 gives the same answer. If we substitute \\(P=2\\), \\(P^*=6\\) and \\(E=2.00\\) in Equation 4.1, we get \\(q=(2.00\\times 6)/2 =6\\), which is exactly the real exchange rate we got in the last paragraph.\nNote that the real exchange rate, being the price of foreign-made goods (measured in units of domestically produced goods), is a measure of the foreign economy’s competitiveness. The higher the value of \\(q\\), the less attractive foreign-made goods would be (to domestic buyers) and the more attractive domestically produced goods would be (to foreign buyers).\n\n4.2.1 Notation: Foreign Country Variables\nAs I did in the case of \\(P^*\\) in Section 4.2, I will use an asterisk (*) as a superscript to mark all foreign variables; i.e., all variables describing the rest of the world.",

    "text": "4.4 What Are Forward Exchange Rates?\nToday’s “30-day forward exchange rate” of the yen in terms of the US dollar is the price—of a yen, in dollars—that you would have to pay for any dollar-yen exchange you agree today to do 30 days later. Only the agreement is signed today; the actual exchange of currencies takes place 30 days later. Let us denote the 30-day forward exchange rate of the foreign currency in terms of the domestic currency by \\(f_{30}\\). So, if \\(f_{30} = 0.095\\) US dollars today, you can sign an agreement today to sell $9.50 thirty days later in exchange for 100 yen.\nBut why would anyone do such a thing? That is, why would one sign an agreement today to make a currency exchange thirty days later? Well, by trading currencies on the forward exchange market, one can avoid exchange rate uncertainty. Suppose you will have to pay someone 100 yen thirty days from today. If you sign a forward-market agreement today and if \\(f_{30}=0.095\\), you’ll know that you’ll need exactly $9.50 thirty days later to make your 100 yen payment. You could instead wait 30 days, go to the foreign exchange spot market and buy 100 yen at whatever spot-market exchange rate prevails at that date. But that would be a gamble: you could end up paying $9.50 or more than $9.50 or less than $9.50 depending on what the spot rate is at that date.\n\n4.4.1 Forward Exchange Rates and Expectations\nIt can be shown that the 30-day forward exchange rate of the yen is a proxy measure of what people currently expect the spot-market value of the yen will be 30 days in the future. That is, if \\(f_{30} = 0.095\\) US dollars per yen today, then it is a safe bet that people today expect that one yen will be worth $0.095 thirty days later in the spot market. Why?\nRecall that the nominal exchange rate (\\(E\\)) is the current spot-market value of one unit of the foreign currency. Using the notational rule set out in Section 2.3.1, let \\(E_f\\) denote the future spot-market value of one unit of the foreign currency. And, finally, let \\(E_f^e\\) denote the current expectation of the future value of the nominal exchange rate. My claim is that \\(f_{30}\\) is a good estimate of \\(E_f^e\\) when the future is 30 days ahead.\nTo see why this is, suppose, to the contrary, that \\(f_{30} = 0.095\\) US dollars per yen today, but that people today think that thirty days later one yen will be worth \\(E_f^e =0.080\\) US dollars in the spot market. Now, if people are more or less convinced that thirty days later they would be able to buy one yen in the spot market for $0.080, why would they rush to the forward market today and pay $0.095 for every yen that they must pledge to buy thirty days later? It doesn’t make sense. If instead we had \\(f_{30} = 0.095\\) and \\(E_f^e =0.099\\), then people would indeed want to buy yen in the forward market.\nBut now nobody would want to sell yen in the forward market. To see why, suppose you are an American exporter and you are expecting a Japanese client to pay you in yen thirty days in the future. You could wait till you receive the yen payment and then sell your yen on the spot market to get dollars, or you could sell the expected receipt of yen on the forward market today. Which would you rather do? As the forward value of a yen is \\(f_{30} = 0.095\\) and you expect that the spot-market value will be \\(E_f^e =0.099\\), you will surely choose to avoid the forward market.\nTo summarize, I have established that if \\(f_{30} &gt; E_f^e\\) then nobody would want to buy the foreign currency in the forward market. I have also established that if \\(f_{30} &lt; E_f^e\\) then nobody would want to sell the foreign currency in the forward market. Therefore, the only reasonable outcome is \\(f_{30} = E_f^e\\). That is, today’s forward-market price of a currency is a good estimate of what people today expect that currency’s spot-market value will be in the future.\nTypically, you can’t tell what people expect the future to be. But in the case of foreign exchange rates at least, there is a way to do so!",

In Section 2.5, \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(NX\\) were defined as the actual magnitudes of gross domestic product, personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, government spending, and net exports of goods and services that are published periodically by government statisticians.

That is, the demand for “Made in USA” goods is given by \\(C+I+G+\\text{Exports}-\\text{Imports}\\) or \\(C+I+G+NX\\), which is precisely what’s on the right hand side of Equation 5.1.\nTherefore, we see that Equation 5.1 does indeed represent equilibrium in the goods market.2\nAs we saw in the previous section, the demand for domestically produced goods, \\(C+I+G+NX\\), is also referred to as aggregate expenditure (\\(AE\\)). Consequently, the goods market equilibrium condition can be written compactly as \\(Y=AE\\).\n\n\n5.1.3 What’s the Use of an Equilibrium Condition?\nWhen the variables in the goods market equilibrium condition, Equation 5.1, are interpreted as in the statistical tables of the United States’ National Income and Product Accounts, it becomes an identity that is useless for theoretical purposes because identities are always true by definition. The definitions in Section 5.1.1 on the other hand interpret the variables as plans or desired levels. Therefore, \\(Y\\) can be thought of as the supply of ‘Made in USA’ goods and the expression on the right hand side of Equation 5.1 can be interpreted as the demand for ‘Made in USA’ goods. Therefore, the goods market equilibrium condition may be seen as another form of the familiar “supply equals demand” idea.\nTo repeat the discussion at the beginning of Section 5.1, unlike Equation 2.5, which is an identity and, therefore, always true by definition, Equation 5.1 is true only under pretty unique circumstances and for pretty unique magnitudes of the variables in the equation. Without equations like the one above, it would be an “anything goes” situation and any useful analysis would be impossible. The equation above asserts, “Only those values of \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\) and \\(NX\\) that obey the equation will prevail in reality.” So, equations like the one above will allow us to be specific about the conditions under which certain important variables, such as \\(Y\\), may increase or decrease.",

    "text": "5.2 Notation: Functional Relationships\nBefore we go any further with our analysis, we need to discuss a notation-related issue.\nIf a variable \\(y\\) is related in some way to a variable \\(x\\), we denote this as \\(y=f(x)\\). There is nothing special about the letter \\(f\\) in the equation: any other letter (or letters) would have done just as well. The key point is that the variable that represents the cause—in this case \\(x\\)—is put within parentheses and the variable that represents the effect—in this case \\(y\\)—is put on the left of the equals sign. Saying \\(y=f(x)\\) amounts to saying that \\(y\\) depends on \\(x\\).\nSimilarly, if a variable \\(z\\) is related to the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we denote this as \\(z=f(x,y)\\).\nTo avoid confusion, when a dot is placed in front of the opening parenthesis—that is, when I write “\\(\\cdot(\\)”—no functional relation is implied.

    "section": "5.3 What Are the Factors that Affect Consumption?",
    "text": "5.3 What Are the Factors that Affect Consumption?\nThe consumption plans of households will be assumed to satisfy the following equation, which is called the consumption function: \n\\[\nC=C(Y-T).\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\nAs we saw in Section 1.4.1, the symbol \\(T\\) denotes the government’s total tax revenues. Therefore, \\(Y-T\\) is the disposable (or after-tax) income of households. Equation 5.2 uses functional notation—see Section 5.2 above—to say that planned consumption spending depends on disposable income.3 More specifically, we assume that consumption is directly related to disposable income: \\(C\\) increases (respectively, decreases) when \\(Y-T\\) increases (respectively, decreases).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Consumption Function. The solid line shows the relation between consuption spending (\\(C\\)) and income (\\(Y\\)) for some specified level of taxes (\\(T\\)). Note that an increase in \\(Y\\) from $1.00 to $2.00 causes \\(C\\) to increase from $2.67 to $3.33. (Don’t be alarmed: \\(C\\) can exceed \\(Y\\) when people dis-save (or, borrow) to spend more than what they earn.) In other words, when \\(Y\\) increases by $1.00, \\(C\\) increases by $0.67, indicating that \\(\\hbox{MPC}=0.67\\). When \\(T\\) increases by $1.00, \\(C\\) decreases—at every level of \\(Y\\)—by the same $0.67. That is, an increase in \\(T\\) causes the entire consumption function to shift downwards to the dotted line.\n\n\n\n\nThis does not mean that consumption is assumed to change only when disposable income changes. Other factors may also affect consumption. For example, if home prices—or, generally speaking, asset prices, such as the prices of the stocks and bonds and real estate owned by households—increase, people may feel wealthy and, as a result, begin to save less and consume more. Changes in interest rates may also affect the desire to save and the urge to consume. Equation 5.2 merely simplifies the story, highlights the role of disposable income, and downplays the effect of asste prices, interest rates, and other variables on consumption spending.\nThe effect of income and taxes on consumption is graphically shown in Figure 5.1. Assuming taxes (\\(T\\)) are unchanged, an increase in income (\\(Y\\)) implies an increase in disposable income (\\(Y-T\\)) and, therefore, an increase in consumption (\\(C\\)), as shown by the solid line in the figure. On the other hand, an increase in \\(T\\) implies a decrease in \\(Y-T\\) at any specified level of \\(Y\\). Therefore, \\(C\\) decreases at every \\(Y\\), implying a downward shift of the consumption function, to the dotted line in Figure 5.1.\n\n5.3.1 The Marginal Propensity to Consume and Ricardian Equivalence\nAn important point to note about the consumption function is that it is often not enough to make the qualitative statement that increases in disposable income lead to increases in consumption spending: the quantitative magnitude of the effect can be important as well. One could ask, “If disposable income (\\(Y-T\\)) increases by one dollar (and if all the other factors that affect consumption spending—such as the asset prices and interest rates mentioned in the last paragraph—remain unchanged), by how many dollars will consumption increase?”\nThe answer to this question is the marginal propensity to consume. For example, if people spend 70 cents out of every dollar of additional disposable income and save the remaining 30 cents, we say that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.70 and the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is 0.30.4\nIn Figure 5.1, for example, the MPC is 0.67. As a result, when \\(Y\\) increases by $1.00, \\(C\\) increases by $0.67. In general, when \\(Y\\) increases (respectively, decreases) by $\\(x\\), \\(C\\) increases (respectively, decreases) by $0.67\\(x\\). On the other hand, a one-dollar increase in \\(T\\) implies a one-dollar decrease in disposable income, causing \\(C\\) to decrease by $0.67 at every value of \\(Y\\). As a result, the consumption function shifts downward by the amount of the MPC when taxes increase by one dollar. In general, when \\(T\\) increases (respectively, decreases) by $\\(y\\), the consumption function shifts down (respectively, up) by $0.67\\(y\\).\nIt is typically assumed that the magnitude of the MPC depends on whether a change in disposable income is perceived to be permanent or temporary. If the income of a household increases by $500 a month and if this is perceived to be a permanent increase, it is reasonable to assume that consumption spending will also increase by nearly $500 a month. In other words, for changes in \\(Y\\) or \\(T\\) that are perceived to be permanent, it is reasonable to assume \\(\\text{MPC}=1\\) and \\(\\text{MPS}=0\\). On the other hand, if the people receive a tax cut in the run-up to an election and come to believe that the tax cut will be revoked once the election is over, then it is reasonable to assume that the people will save the bonanza from the tax cut. In other words, for changes in \\(Y\\) or \\(T\\) that are perceived to be temporary, it is reasonable to assume \\(\\text{MPC}=0\\) and \\(\\text{MPS}=1\\).5\nPeople’s estimation of the permanence of a tax cut may also depend on whether the tax cut is accompanied by a cut in government spending, \\(G\\). If there is a cut in taxes but none in government spending, the government would have to borrow from private lenders (for example, banks) to make up the shortfall in tax revenue. But the borrowed money would eventually have to be repayed—with interest. Where would the government get the money to do so? It would probably raise taxes.6 Therefore, if people are smart enough, they may come to believe that a tax cut unaccompanied by a cut in government spending is very likely a temporary tax cut that would lead eventually to a tax hike larger than the tax cut itself. They may therefore respond to the tax cut, not by going on a shopping spree, but instead by socking the tax cut away in a bank thinking that a big tax increase is on the way.\nThis sceptical view of the effect of a tax cut on consumption spending is referred to as the theory of Ricardian equivalence. Let’s consider this further with a numerical example. Suppose the government reduces taxes (\\(T\\)) from $1000 to $900 but leaves annual government spending (\\(G\\)) unchanged at $1000. The government borrows $100 from a bank at a 7% interest rate to make up the shortfall in tax revenue. Therefore, a year later the government would have to repay $107 to the bank. Therefore, people may conclude that the $100 tax cut is illusory and would inevitably be followed by a $107 tax increase a year later—to the level of $1107 to pay for $1000 in government spending plus $107 in loan repayment. Knowing that they would need an extra $107 next year, what would the people do? They would take the $100 tax cut and put it in a bank so that, at 7% interest, they would have enough next year to pay the tax hike they know is coming.\nIn other words, when a reduction in \\(T\\) is not accompanied by an equal cut in \\(G\\), \\(\\hbox{MPC}=0\\) and \\(\\hbox{MPS}=1\\).\nAnother implication of the theory of Ricardian equivalence is that in some circumstances consumption spending may respond as if taxes have changed even if they actually haven’t! Let’s say government spending increases by $100 but taxes stay the same. Once again, the government would have to borrow $100 from a bank. Therefore, a year later it would need to raise taxes by $107 (assuming 7% interest, as before) to repay the loan with interest. Therefore, taxes would have to rise next year by $107. Therefore, if people anticipate all this, they would put away an extra $100 in their bank accounts in preparation for the $107 tax increase they can see coming. In other words, if \\(G\\) increases and \\(Y-T\\) remains unchanged, \\(C\\) would fall, as if the people are saying to themselves that taxes have risen even though they actually have not.\nTherefore, according to Ricardian equivalence, when analysing the effect of a change in government spending it might be a good idea to pretend that the change in \\(G\\) is accompanied by an equal change in \\(T\\), even if \\(T\\) is actually unchanged.",

    "text": "5.4 What Are the Factors that Affect Investment?\nUnlike consumption spending (\\(C\\)), which has been assumed above to depend on disposable income (\\(Y-T\\)), the total of the investment plans of businesses (\\(I\\)) is assumed, for simplicity, to dance to its own tune, to be unrelated to other economic variables.\nTo use a term that will be explained in Section 6.1.1, investment will be assumed here to be an exogenous variable. You will see later that fluctuations in \\(I\\) can explain fluctuations in other variables such as \\(Y\\). But you will see no explanation of the fluctuations in \\(I\\) itself. Investment will be used here as an explanatory variable, but it will remain unexplained itself.\nIn a theory that argues that increases in temperature cause increases in murder rates, but has nothing to say about what causes temperature to increase, temperature is exogenous and the murder rate is endogenous. In this case, the author of the theory may be admitting that the weather is too complex to explain. Or, perhaps she has concluded that trying to explain the weather would be a waste of time: as we cannot control the weather, it would make sense to forget about what causes temperature fluctuations and instead concentrate on how to deploy the police strategically on hot days to keep murder rates from spiking. Either way, weather is being treated as exogenous.\nReturning to the issue at hand, investment is actually not entirely mysterious. A strong case can be made that \\(I\\) depends on the real (or, inflation-adjusted) interest rate, which is the inflation-adjusted cost of the money that businesses need to borrow in order to pay for their investment spending.7\nAdvances in technology and increases in the quantity and quality of a nation’s work force are important influences too. When such changes happen, the productivity of capital goods (such as equipment, machinery, software, etc.) increases. This induces greater investment in additional capital goods.8\nThat said, most economists agree that investment spending by businesses is overwhelmingly dependent on that elusive thing called the optimism or the “animal spirits” of businesspeople. And, as business psychology is not their strong suite, economists tend not to say much about such things. I will simply assume that the level of investment is exogenous or inexplicable—it is what it is.",

    "section": "5.6 What Are the Factors that Affect Net Exports?",
    "text": "5.6 What Are the Factors that Affect Net Exports?\nAs we saw in Section 2.4.4 and Section 5.1.1, net exports is the excess of exports over imports: \\[\nNX\\equiv EX-IM,\n\\tag{5.3}\\] where, \\(EX\\) denotes the real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) value of the planned sales of domestically produced goods and services to foreign residents, and \\(IM\\) denotes the real value of the demand for foreign-made goods from domestic residents. Therefore, to understand what drives \\(NX\\) up and down, we need to look at what makes \\(EX\\) and \\(IM\\) fluctuate.\n\n5.6.1 What Are the Factors that Affect Exports?\nI will assume that the demand from foreign residents for the goods and services produced in the domestic economy—i.e., the domestic country’s exports—is given by\n\\[\nEX=EX(q),\n\\tag{5.4}\\] where, as was pointed out in Section 4.2, the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) is the amount of domestically produced goods that can be obtained in trade for one unit of foreign-made goods. As the real exchange rate is the relative price of foreign goods (in units of domestic goods), a rise in \\(q\\) would encourage foreigners to buy more domestic goods. That is, \\(EX\\) and \\(q\\) are directly related.\nThe real exchange rate, however, is not the only thing that affects exports. An important influence is foreign GDP. For example, countries such as China, Japan, and Germany saw sharp declines in their exports to the US during the US recession of 2008–09. To keep things simple, however, I will ignore this issue and assume that \\(EX\\) depends on \\(q\\) alone.\n\n\n5.6.2 What Are the Factors that Affect Imports?\nI will assume that the domestic country’s demand for foreign-made goods—i.e., its imports—is given by\n\\[\nIM=IM(q,Y-T).\n\\tag{5.5}\\]\nSince the real exchange rate, \\(q\\), is the amount of domestically produced goods that can be obtained in trade for one unit of foreign-made goods, it should be clear that a high level of \\(q\\) would discourage the import of foreign-made goods; i.e., \\(q\\) and \\(IM\\) are inversely related.\nAnd, as we saw in Section 5.3 above, increases in disposable income (\\(Y-T\\)) lead to increases in consumption spending (\\(C\\)). Part of this additional consumption is likely to consist of foreign-made goods. Therefore, it follows in an obvious way that \\(Y-T\\) and \\(IM\\) are directly related. Moreover, it also follows that when disposable income increases, consumption increases more than imports do. That is, the marginal propensity to import is smaller than the marginal propensity to consume.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that just as the effect of a change in disposable income on consumption spending depends on whether the change in disposable income is perceived to be permanent or temporary—see Section 5.3.1 for a reminder—so does the effect of a change in disposable income on households’ purchases of imported goods.\n\n\n5.6.3 Summary: What Are the Factors that Affect Net Exports?\nSection 5.6.1 and Section 5.6.2 imply that we can summarize the nature of a country’s net exports by the equation\n\\[\nNX=NX(q,Y-T).\n\\tag{5.6}\\]\nMoreover, we can conclude that net exports (\\(NX\\)) is related directly to the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) and inversely to disposable income (\\(Y-T\\)).\nThese effects of \\(q\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(T\\) on \\(NX\\) are shown graphically in the two panels of figure Figure 5.2. The left panel emphasizes the role of the real exchange rate in a nation’s net exports. This rising net exports curve shifts rightward when \\(Y-T\\) decreases, indicating lower imports and, therefore, higher net exports at every value of \\(q\\). The right panel of figure Figure 5.2, on the other hand, emphasizes the role of GDP in determining a nation’s net exports. This net exports curve is negatively sloped, indicating that rising incomes lead to rising imports and, therefore, falling net exports. Both graphical representations of \\(NX\\) in figure Figure 5.2 are useful, depending on the context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Net Exports This figure shows that both the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) and taxes (\\(T\\)) have a direct effect on net exports (\\(NX\\)) and that GDP (\\(Y\\)) has an inverse effect. The left panel highlights the effect of the real exchange rate. This curve shifts right when \\(Y-T\\) decreases. The right panel highlights the effect of real GDP. This curve shifts down when either \\(q\\) or \\(T\\) decreases. Note that net exports could be positive or negative. Absolute purchasing power parity is not assumed for this diagram.\n\n\n\n\nThe direct relation between \\(NX\\) and \\(q\\) is shown one more time in figure Figure 5.3. The left panel in particular shows that as \\(q\\) increases from \\(q_B\\) to \\(q_A\\), \\(NX\\) increases from \\(NX=0\\) to \\(NX=NX_A\\). Had the net exports curve instead been the flatter dotted line, the same change in the real exchange rate would have provoked a bigger change in net exports. In other words, the flatter the net exports curve is—or, the more elastic it is, if you can forgive the jargon—the more responsive \\(NX\\) is to \\(q\\). In the extreme case of infinite responsiveness or elasticity, the net exports curve is horizontal.\nIf, moreover, the net exports curve is horizontal at \\(q=1\\), as in the right panel of figure Figure 5.3, it is said to obey the law of one price or absolute purchasing power parity. This is discussed further in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Net Exports and the Real Exchange Rate The left panel shows a general direct relation between net exports and the real exchange rate. Note that net exports could be positive or negative. The right panel shows the relation between net exports and the real exchange rate under the law of one price or, equivalently, under absolute purchasing power parity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.4 The Law of One Price and Purchasing Power Parity\nThe direct relation between net exports and the real exchange rate, when taken to an extreme, leads to the law of one price or, equivalently, absolute purchasing power parity (PPP). This requires that net exports be infinitely elastic with respect to changes in the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) and that\n\\[\nq\\equiv\\frac{E\\cdot P^*}{P}=1.\n\\tag{5.7}\\]\nThe first equality in Equation 5.7 is simply the algebraic definition of the real exchange rate that we saw in Equation 4.1 of Section 4.2. What is new in Equation 5.7 is its insistence that \\(q=1\\).\nTo see the logic behind this, let us work through an example. Suppose the price, \\(P\\), of American wheat is 2 dollars per pound; the price, \\(P^*\\), of French wheat is 3 euros per pound; and the price of a euro, \\(E\\), is $2.00. Therefore, the price of French wheat in US dollars is \\(E\\times P^*=2.00\\times 3=6\\) US dollars, thrice the price of identical US wheat.\nHow likely is this situation—in which the real exchange rate is \\(q=2.00\\times 3/2=3\\)—to persist? Not very likely, is the clear answer. People all over the world will see a juicy opportunity for arbitrage , which is a fancy term for the practice of making money by buying something at a cheap price and selling it at a higher price. People will start buying American wheat to sell in France. As long as \\(q=3\\) persists, nobody will wish to sell wheat in the US and everybody will want to make money by buying up every grain of US wheat and selling it in France. This is clearly unsustainable. Net exports from America to France will be literally infinite!\nOn the other hand, suppose \\(P=2\\) dollars per pound of American wheat, as before; \\(E=2.00\\) dollars per euro, also as before; but \\(P^*=0.50\\) euros per pound of French wheat. Now the price of French wheat in dollars is \\(E\\times P^*=2.00\\times 0.50=1\\) dollar, half the price of identical American wheat.\nHow likely is this situation—in which the real exchange rate is \\(q=2.00\\times 0.50/2.00=0.50\\)—to persist? Again, not very likely. People will now wish to buy every grain of French wheat for sale in America. Net exports from America to France will now be negative infinity, which is clearly an unsustainable situation.\nFor planned net exports to be neither infinity nor negative infinity, the price of wheat must be equal in America and France (when both prices are measured in the same currency). This is the basic idea of the law of one price: the price of any tradable commodity, when measured with the same yardstick, should be the same everywhere if there are no trade-related costs.\nTo be specific, note that when I calculated the price of French wheat in dollars in the numerical examples above, I multiplied \\(E\\) and \\(P^*\\). Therefore, saying that the price of wheat, when measured in the same currency, should be the same in America and France amounts to saying that \\[\nE\\cdot P^* = P,\n\\] which in turn implies \\(q=1\\) or absolute purchasing power parity, as in Equation 5.7.\nNote also that as the magnitude of America’s net exports is infinity when American goods are cheaper than French goods (\\(q&gt;1\\)) and negative infinity when American goods are pricier than French goods (\\(q&lt;1\\)), a finite level of net exports is possible only when \\(q=1\\). This is graphically represented by the horizontal net exports curve in the right panel of Figure 5.2.\nThe notion of absolute purchasing power parity does have a common-sense appeal. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to fit the facts very well, partly because many goods and services (haircuts and dry cleaning, for example) are not traded across large distances. Real exchange rates have been observed to stay higher than 1.0 (or lower than 1.0) for long periods of time. Therefore, in these lectures, I will not assume absolute purchasing power parity. Instead, a less stringent version of the idea—relative purchasing power parity—will be used.10",

    "text": "5.8 What is the Money Market Equilibrium Condition?\nThe money market equilibrium condition requires that the financial assets that are held by the people be held willingly, and not under some sort of compulsion. For that to be the case, money supply must be equal to money demand .\n\n5.8.1 What Is the Money Supply?\nRoughly, the nation’s money supply at any given moment is the total amount of liquid assets —that is, assets that can easily be used to pay for purchases when you go shopping—that are held by private citizens at that moment. A popular measure of money supply is M1. It consists of all currency in private hands and all the money in people’s checking accounts. You may think of M1 as the maximum amount of money that people would be able to spend if they all went shopping this minute. See Figure 5.4 for recent trends in M1 for the United States. For instance, on October 22, 2012, M1 was an estimated $2,417.2 billion, of which currency in private hands was $1,079.2 billion, total checkable deposits was $1,334.0 billion, and travelers checks outstanding was $3.9 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: One measure of money supply is M1. Here we see recent US data on M1. Note that the Federal Reserve’s actions tend to sharply boost money supply in recessions. We will see why in later chapters. Source: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL.\n\n\n\n\nAs we saw in Section 1.4.2, I will denote money supply by the symbol \\(M\\).\n\n\n5.8.2 What Are the Factors that Affect Money Supply?\nA nation’s money supply is controlled by its central bank.11 Recall that M1, the simplest measure of \\(M\\), is basically equal to the currency held by the public and the value of all checkable bank accounts. The central bank can use its power to affect both these components of M1. The central bank is the only institution that can print (or mint) currency. Therefore, the “currency held by the public” can increase only if the central bank buys something from John or Jane Q. Public and pays for it with newly printed cash.\nFor instance, if Jane decides to sell some of the government bonds that she owns, she may end up selling her bonds to the central bank in return for a bunch of newly printed currency notes. This would imply an increase in the currency held by the public and, therefore, in M1. Or, it could be that John has some yen that he wishes to sell in return for dollars. John could end up selling his yen to the U.S. central bank, which is known as the Federal Reserve or, simply, The Fed. Again, he would be paid in crisp newly printed dollar bills, the currency held by the public would increase, as would M1.\nOf course, the central bank could just as easily decide to sell some of its financial assets. In that case, the above process would work in reverse and M1 would decrease. If the Fed decides to sell some of the government bonds it owns, the buyer could be one John Q. Public. In this case, John would hand over some not-so-crisp dollar bills from his wallet to the Fed as payment for the bonds he had just purchased. Consequently, the currency held by the public would decrease, as would M1.\nApart from controlling the currency held by the public in the manner just outlined, a central bank indirectly controls “the value of all checkable bank accounts”, which is the other component of M1. This is because a central bank typically has the power to regulate the lending behavior of banks. If I walk into a bank and deposit a hundred dollars into my account, the bank manager would lend \\(X\\) dollars out of the money I had deposited to someone who wants a loan. That man may use the \\(X\\) dollars he had borrowed to buy a shirt, in which case those \\(X\\) dollars would end up in the shirt seller’s checkable bank account. Therefore, M1 would increase by \\(X\\) dollars. In other words, the lending of depositors’ money by banks can affect M1.\nAnd that’s where the central bank can use its regulatory power to control the value of all checkable bank accounts and, thereby, M1. The central bank can set limits on how much of my hundred-dollar deposit my bank could lend. By adjusting the limit the central bank can encourage the manager of my bank to lend more or less than \\(X\\) dollars to the guy who wanted a loan. Thereby, the central bank can (indirectly) control the rate at which bank lending expands M1.\nIn some cases, central banks give up control over the money supply in order to exert control over some other economic variable that they consider important to control. You will see in Chapter 8 that in what are called fixed exchange rate systems, the central bank can fix the value of a currency by credibly promising to buy and/or sell that currency at the target rate of exchange. For example, if the central bank of Thailand wishes to fix the exchange value of the Thai baht at 25 bahts per US dollar, it can do so by announcing that it is ready to buy and/or sell US dollars at the rate of 25 bahts per dollar. After that announcement, the market price of a dollar could not be, say, 27 baht because nobody would buy a dollar at that price when Thailand’s central bank is willing to sell dollars for less. Similarly, the price of a dollar could not be 23 baht because nobody would sell at that price given that they could instead sell dollars to the Thai central bank for a higher price. In short, once Thailand’s central bank makes a credible announcement that it will exchange one dollar for 25 baht, the market exchange rate of a dollar will quickly become 25 baht.\nHowever, the Thai central bank’s efforts to control the exchange rate of the baht must come at the expense of its total loss of control over Thailand’s M1. If people show up with dollars and ask for baht, the central bank would have to print some additional currency. So, currency held by the public would increase, as would M1. If some Thai citizens hand over their baht and ask for dollars, the central bank would have to dig into its dollar reserves to keep its promise. The baht held by the thai public would decrease (because they have exhanged some of their baht for dollars), as would M1. In this way, the central bank would gain some control over the exchange rate, but by giving up control over M1. M1 would now fluctuate not according to the wishes of the Thai central bank but in tune with economic conditions in Thailand or, indeed, the world at large.\n\n\n5.8.3 What Is the Money Demand?\nThe nation’s money demand at a specified point in time is the total amount of liquid assets—that is, currency plus checkable bank accounts—that its residents would like to hold at that point in time.\n\n\n5.8.4 What Are the Factors that Affect the Demand for Money?\nThe behavior of the demand for money is assumed to be described by the equation \\[\n\\text{Money Demand}=L(R)\\cdot P\\cdot Y.\n\\]\nIn other words, the demand for money is assumed to be a multiple \\(L\\) of nominal income (\\(P\\cdot Y\\); see Equation 2.12 of Section 2.6.1). Moreover, the multiple \\(L\\) itself depends on the nominal interest rate (\\(R\\)).\n\n5.8.4.1 What Are Nominal Interest Rates?\nThe nominal interest rate, denoted by \\(R\\) for the domestic country and \\(R^*\\) for the foreign country, is the fraction of each currency unit borrowed (dollar, yen, etc.) that will have to be paid as interest.12 If the bank charges you 15% interest on a loan, then the nominal interest rate is \\(R=0.15\\) because that is the fraction of each dollar borrowed that you will have to pay as interest.\n\n\n5.8.4.2 Again, What Are the Factors that Affect the Demand for Money?\nAs is clear from the equation above, the demand for money is assumed to vary directly with \\(P\\) and \\(Y\\). This makes sense. If, other things being unchanged, the average price level (\\(P\\)) goes up, wouldn’t you wish to keep a larger part of your wealth as cash in your wallet? Of course, you would. And if GDP (\\(Y\\)) increases, wouldn’t people carry more cash in their wallets? Of course, they would. A higher real GDP implies that more goods and services are being produced and then bought and sold. All this extra buying and selling will require people to carry more cash with them on a regular basis.\nAnd, as for the effect of \\(R\\) on money demand, if the nominal interest rate increases, wouldn’t you wish to keep less of your wealth in cash? Yes, you would. Keep in mind that liquid assets, such as cash and checking account deposits, are convenient when you need to go shopping, but earn little or no interest. The nominal interest rate \\(R\\) is the interest rate on non-liquid assets , such as bonds. So, a higher nominal interest rate increases the attractiveness of non-liquid assets and thereby reduces the desirability of liquid assets. Therefore, \\(R\\) and \\(L\\)—and, therefore, \\(R\\) and money demand—are inversely related.13\nOther factors matter too. For example, in an economic crisis, when people are unsure that borrowers will be able to repay their loans, they may keep more of their wealth in the form of cold hard cash instead of lending it to others. On the other hand, when people are wealthier, they would very likely carry more cash.14\n\n\n\n5.8.5 Summary: What Is the Money Market Equilibrium Condition?\nThe necessary equality of the supply and demand for money gives us what is usually called the money market equilibrium condition :\n\\[\n\\fbox{$\\displaystyle M=L(R)\\cdot P\\cdot Y.$}\n\\tag{5.9}\\]",

    "section": "5.9 What Is the Equilibrium Condition for the Foreign Exchange Market?",
    "text": "5.9 What Is the Equilibrium Condition for the Foreign Exchange Market?\nForeign exchange markets are said to be in equilibrium if, for any two currencies \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the amount of Currency \\(A\\) supplied—by those who wish to sell Currency \\(A\\) in exchange for Currency \\(B\\)—is equal to the amount of Currency \\(A\\) demanded—by those who wish to sell Currency \\(B\\) in exchange for Currency \\(A\\). For this to be true, uncovered interest arbitrage must not be possible.\nPeople may wish to exchange currency \\(A\\) for currency \\(B\\) for many reasons. They may be tourists who have currency \\(A\\) but wish to travel in regions where currency \\(B\\) is accepted. They may be people who have currency \\(A\\) but wish to buy goods, services, or assets from people who accept only currency \\(B\\). However, I will focus on one particular reason why people trade currencies: it involves speculation (or, less politely, financial gambling) and is called uncovered interest arbitrage. The foreign currency markets are in equilibrium when the demand and supply from these speculators are perfectly matched.\n\n5.9.1 What Is Uncovered Interest Arbitrage?\nOpportunities for uncovered interest arbitrage are said to exist if one can expect to profit by borrowing money in country \\(A\\) and lending it to borrowers in country \\(B\\), or vice versa.15 If this is possible, then there would be no equilibrium in the foreign exchange market. Profit seekers would be constantly borrowing money in country \\(A\\) and then changing it into the currency of country \\(B\\) for the purpose of lending it to borrowers in that country. There would be literally no limit to the amount of country \\(A\\)’s currency supplied by these people and—for the same reason—no limit to the amount of country \\(B\\)’s currency demanded by these people. As a result, the supply of country \\(A\\)’s currency would necessarily exceed the demand for it. Such a situation would not represent equilibrium.\nTherefore, for equilibrium in foreign exchange markets, there must not exist any opportunities for uncovered interest arbitrage. Put another way, the uncovered interest parity condition must be satisfied.\n\n\n5.9.2 What Is the Uncovered Interest Parity Condition?\nThe uncovered interest parity condition (UIP, for short) is that \\[\nR=R^*+\\frac{E^e_f-E}{E}\n\\tag{5.10}\\] must be satisfied.\nAs we saw in Section 5.8.4.1 above, \\(R\\) is the nominal interest rate in the home country, whereas \\(R^*\\) is the nominal interest rate in the foreign country. As we saw in Section 4.1, \\(E\\) is the current value of the foreign currency in units of the domestic currency. And, as we saw in Section 4.4.1, \\(E_f\\) is the future value of the foreign currency, and \\(E_f^e\\) is the current expectation of the future value of the foreign currency.16\nNote that \\(E^e_f-E\\) is the expected increase in the exchange value of the foreign currency. It then follows—along the lines of Equation 2.3 in Section 2.3.1 — that \\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nE^e_g&\\equiv&\\frac{E^e_f-E}{E}\\nonumber \\\\\n&\\equiv&\\frac{E^e_f}{E}-1\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{5.11}\\] is the expected proportional rate of increase of the exchange value of the foreign currency. The uncovered interest parity equation above can therefore be written compactly as \\[\nR=R^*+E_g^e.\n\\tag{5.12}\\]\nThe second term on the right-hand side, \\(E_g^e\\), is often called the expected rate of appreciation of the foreign currency . When the exchange value of a currency increases (respectively, decreases), the currency is said to have appreciated (respectively, depreciated) .17\nWith the definitions of the variables in Equation 5.10 out of the way, we can now try to understand why that equation makes sense.\n\n5.9.2.1 Why Is Uncovered Interest Parity Necessary for Equilibrium?\nTo see the meaning of Equation 5.10 above, consider the prospect of borrowing US dollars from someone in America today, turning it into euros in the foreign exchange market, lending it to someone in Europe for a year, turning the euros received a year later (as principal and interest on the loan that was made) back into dollars, paying off the dollars that had been borrowed a year earlier, and keeping any profits or losses that remain.\nThe downside of this plan is that you would have to pay interest \\(R\\) on the money you borrowed in America. This is on the left-hand side of the UIP equation; i.e., Equation 5.10.\nBut there is an upside too. You will get interest \\(R^*\\) from your borrowers in Europe.\nAnd that is not all. Remember that the plan requires you to change your borrowed dollars into euros today and then change your euros back into dollars a year later. So, you would make some money if the nominal value of the euro, \\(E\\), grows during the year. For example, if \\(E = 2\\) today, you would pay $2.00 for every euro you buy today. And if \\(E_f^e = 4\\) a year later, you would be able to turn each euro you have into $4.00. So, if \\(E\\) grows from \\(E = 2\\) at the beginning of the year to \\(E^e_f = 4\\) at the year’s end, you could turn $2.00 into $4.00 over that year. In general, \\(E^e_g\\equiv(E^e_f-E)/E\\) represents your expected gains from changing dollars into euros and back into dollars a year later.\nTherefore, the right-hand side of the UIP equation above—i.e., \\(R^* + E^e_g\\)—represents your total gains from this convoluted scheme of borrowing dollars, changing it into euros, earning interest on those euros for a year, and finally changing the euros back into dollars and bringing the money home.\nHad the left-hand side (\\(R\\)) been smaller than the right-hand side (\\(R^* + E^e_g\\)), opportunities for uncovered interest arbitrage would have existed. That is, you (and everybody else in the world) would have profited from borrowing in America and lending that money in Europe. But that would have violated the equilibrium condition for the foreign exchange markets.\nIn the same way, it can be shown that had the left-hand side been greater than the right-hand side, opportunities for uncovered interest arbitrage would once again have existed. Only, this time you would expect to gain by borrowing in Europe and lending in America.\nSo, for equilibrium in the foreign exchange market, the two sides of Equation 5.10 would have to be equal. That is, for equilibrium in the foreign exchange market, the uncovered interest parity condition must be satisfied. This can be expressed either by Equation 5.10 or, equivalently, by \\[\n\\fbox{$\\displaystyle R=R^*+\\frac{E^e_f}{E}-1.$}\n\\tag{5.13}\\]\n\n\n5.9.2.2 Perfect Capital Mobility\nMy discussion of the uncovered interest parity condition in Section 5.9.2.1 has implicitly assumed perfect capital mobility in foreign exchange markets. This requires that:\n\nAll individuals have the same expectations, and\nWhen considering which assets to buy and which assets to sell, people only look at the long-run average returns of the various available assets.18\n\nThe first requirement was discussed in Section 5.9.2 on \\(E_f^e\\).\nThe second requirement of perfect capital mobility is that the long-run average return of an asset is all that we care about when judging the attractiveness of an asset. This idea is implicit in the discussion of uncovered interest parity in Section 5.9.2.1. If you borrow money in America and lend it in Europe, the benefits of all this wheeling and dealing are measured by \\(R^*+[(E^e_f-E)/E]\\). This is just the long-run average return that you would expect to receive. The UIP equation, Equation 5.10, therefore, reflects what equilibrium in foreign exchange markets ought to look like if these long-run average returns are all that matter to people.\nPerfect capital mobility, therefore, implies that the UIP equation must be satisfied for the foreign exchange market to be in equilibrium.\nWe need to remember, however, that although I have assumed perfect capital mobility, I did so just for simplicity. In the real world, perfect capital mobility is unlikely to be true. First of all, different people cannot be expected to have the same expectations. Secondly, in judging the attractiveness of an asset, people are likely to look not only at the asset’s long-run average return but also at the volatility (or variability, or dispersion, or riskiness) of the asset’s return. Consider asset \\(A\\), which gives a steady 5% return, and another asset, asset \\(B\\), which yields a 0% return half the time and a 10% return half the time, for a long-run average return of 5%. Assets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both have the same long-run average return of 5%. And yet, most people will not regard assets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to be equally attractive; most people will regard asset \\(A\\) to be superior because it is less risky.\nIn my justification of uncovered interest parity in Section 5.9.2.1, I focused on the long-run average returns and ignored the riskiness of assets. For example, I assumed that people consider \\((E^e_f-E)/E\\), the expected appreciation of the foreign currency, but ignore the fact that even if people have an expectation about how much that currency may appreciate, they will also be aware that that expectation is just that, an expectation.\nTherefore, one needs to keep in mind the limitations inherent in defining equilibrium in foreign exchange markets by Equation 5.10.",

    "text": "To be precise, in Equation 2.8, \\(Y\\) denotes gross national domestic income, which is slightly different from gross domestic product, and \\(CA\\) denotes the current account balance which is slightly different from \\(NX\\) or net exports. However, these small differences—see Section 2.5.1.2 and Section 2.5.1.3 — are not the main issue here. The main distinction between Equation 5.1 on the one hand and the national income identity—that is, Equation 2.5 or Equation 2.8 — on the other is that Equation 5.1 has a theoretical justification, whereas Equation 2.5 and Equation 2.8 are true by virtue of how the variables in them are defined by statisticians. The theory that says that Equation 5.1 is true may be false. But the national income identity is necessarily true by virtue of the definitions of the variables in it.↩︎\nReaders may recall a parallel discussion of the national income identity in Section 2.5.↩︎\nNote that \\(Y\\) is defined as the supply of goods planned by domestic producers. If the producers’ desires are fulfilled, \\(Y\\) would also be the actual sales of domestic producers. Therefore, \\(Y\\) would also be the total income of households because the total sales of final goods must also be equal to total earnings. After all, if ten trillion dollars worth of “Made in USA” goods were produced and sold last year, how did the ten trillion dollars that buyers paid for those goods end up? As the incomes of all the people involved in their production, of course.↩︎\nNote that \\(0&lt;\\hbox{MPC},\\hbox{MPS}&lt;1\\) and that \\(\\hbox{MPC}+\\hbox{MPS}=1\\), by definition.↩︎\nFor a full discussion, see pages 163-5 of Macroeconomics: A Modern Approach by Robert J. Barro, Thomson South-Western, Mason, OH, 2008.↩︎\nThe government could take out a new loan to repay an old loan. But there are limits to how far this could be continued. Lenders may eventually balk.↩︎\nIndeed, in a later chapter I will assume that real investment spending, \\(I\\), is inversely related to the real interest rate, \\(r\\).↩︎\nSee chapter 17 of Macroeconomics, sixth edition, by N. Gregory Mankiw, Worth Publishers, New York, NY, 2007, ISBN:978–0–7167–6213–3, for more on the theory of business investment.↩︎\nI should not, however, give the impression that factors that influence the level of government spending are not discussed in economic research. See Mueller (2003), Persson and Tabellini (2002), and Drazen (2002).↩︎\nSee Section 10.4 of Chapter 10. ↩︎\nSee Section 3.3.↩︎\nRecall from Section 4.2.1 that the variables that describe a foreign country have an asterisk (*) attached as a superscript.↩︎\nThe factor \\(L\\) is the reciprocal of what is called the velocity of money or the income velocity of money, \\(V\\). That is, \\(L=1/V\\). The velocity is defined as the average number of times per period that a unit of currency is used in the purchase of a final good or service. For example, if the average dollar bill changes hands 10 times per month, then \\(V=10\\).↩︎\nDuring the recession of 2008–09, many people who had borrowed money to buy homes, defaulted on their loans when home prices, which they had thought would keep rising, fell instead. This shocking rise in loan defaults made lenders afraid to lend money. The sudden decline in the availability of loans made it hard for businesses to borrow money to expand. The sales of new homes and cars fell sharply because consumer loans dried up. All this led to sharp declines in real GDP and sharp rises in unemployment in the US. These troubles in the US had serious negative effects on other countries as well.↩︎\nIn the business press, uncovered interest arbitrage is also referred to as the “carry trade.” See, for example, “Why the ‘Carry Trade’ Is Back,” by Neil Shah, The Wall Street Journal, August 18, 2009, https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125053694840237795. ↩︎\nNote that, I have quietly assumed that everybody has the same expectation for the future value of the foreign currency; no differences of opinion are allowed. Also, you may recall that \\(E_f^e\\) was introduced earlier in Section 4.4.↩︎\nSimilarly, \\(100\\times[(E^e_f-E)/E]\\) is the expected percentage rate of increase of the exchange value of the foreign currency. Note that when \\(E^e_f&lt;E\\), we have a negative expected increase, which is the same as a decrease.↩︎\nThe long-run average return of an asset is also called the mathematical expectation of the returns of the asset.↩︎",

    "text": "a list of exogenous variables,\na list of endogenous variables, and\na bunch of equations that show how the variables are related to each other.\n\n\n\n6.1.1 What Are Exogenous Variables?\nA variable is said to be exogenous to a theory if the theory does not seek to explain the ups and downs of the variable.\nConsider a theory of, say, the crime rate that says that a city’s crime rate goes up (respectively, down) when it has less (respectively, more) rain, but is totally silent about why the amount of rain itself might go up or down. For such a theory, the amount of rain is an exogenous variable.1\nExogenous variables are basically of two types: policy variables and shocks . Policy variables are those exogenous variables whose values can be raised or lowered by policy makers or administrators in the government. All other exogenous variables are called shocks.\n\n\n6.1.2 What Are Endogenous Variables?\nA variable is endogenous to a theory if the theory aims to explain why that variable might increase or decrease.\nIn the example that was just considered, the crime rate is the endogenous variable.\n\n\n6.1.3 How Many Equations Are Enough?\nRecall that a theory must have a set of equations that show how the various exogenous and endogenous variables are related to each other. The question now is: How many equations should a theory have? And the short answer is: as many equations as are necessary to enable the theory to do what it is supposed to do, which is to predict the up/down movements of the theory’s endogenous variables.\nTo predict whether a particular endogenous variable would increase or decrease if some exogenous variable, say, increases from a low value to a high value, we would need to be able to pin down the values taken by the endogenous variable at the low and high values of the exogenous variable. Once that is done it would become clear whether the increase in the exogenous variable causes the endogenous variable to increase or decrease or stay unchanged. To illustrate with the theory of crime that we discussed earlier, if the equations in that theory of crime allow us to pin down the value of the crime rate both when the amount of rain is high and when the amount of rain is low, then we would know how an increase (or decrease) in the amount of rain would affect crime.\n\nTheorem 6.1 (Solving Equations) To pin down the values of the various endogenous variables of a theory we in general need exactly as many equations as there are endogenous variables: not more, not less. If there are more endogenous variables than there are equations, we would generally get many possible solutions, and that would make it impossible to say anything definite. If there are fewer endogenous variables than there are equations we would generally get no solutions at all.\n\n\nTo see this idea in action, let us try some numbers. Let’s say a theory has\n\ntwo endogenous variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and\nthree exogenous variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\nCase 1 Let’s suppose that the theory consists of just one equation: \\[\nx + y = a + \\frac{b}{c}.\n\\tag{6.1}\\] Assume that \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = c = 6\\). It should then be clear that it is impossible to pin down a unique set of values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For example, (\\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 2\\)), (\\(x = 3\\) and \\(y = 1\\)), and (\\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 3\\)) are only three of infinitely many sets of values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that are solutions to Equation 6.1 in this case.\nNow, the whole point of a theory is to predict how changes in the exogenous variables affect the endogenous variables. For example, one might ask what would happen to \\(x\\) if \\(b\\) increased from 6 to 12. Answering this question would be easy if there existed a unique value of \\(x\\) when \\(a=3\\), \\(b=6\\) and \\(c=6\\) and a unique value of \\(x\\) when \\(a=3\\), \\(b=12\\) and \\(c=6\\). Unfortunately, Equation 6.1 can’t tell us what \\(x\\) is when \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 6\\) and \\(c = 6\\) and or what \\(x\\) is when \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 12\\) and \\(c = 6\\). We, therefore, see that if a theory’s equations can’t give us unique solutions for the theory’s endogenous variables, then that theory is useless.\nCase 2 Let’s now suppose that the theory consists of three equations—Equation 6.1 above and the two equations below: \\[\nx - y = a - \\frac{b}{c}\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\n\\[\nx  = a -c\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nIt should be clear that it is impossible, in general, to find any values of the endogenous variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that would satisfy all three equations. For \\(a=3\\) and \\(b=c=6\\), the equations become \\[\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nx + y &=& 4\\\\\nx - y &=& 2\\\\\nx &=& -3\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\] respectively. If you try a few numbers, you will soon see that not all three equations can simultaneously be satisfied. If you substitute \\(x = -3\\), which is the third equation, into the first equation, you’ll get \\(y = 7\\). But in that case the second equation cannot be satisfied because \\(x - y\\) would be -10, not 2, which is what the second equation requires.\nCase 3 If, however, the theory has two equations—the same number as the number of endogenous variables—a unique set of solutions for the endogenous variables can usually be found. Let’s say the theory’s equations are Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 above, but not Equation 6.3. Then it is clear that \\(x = 3\\) and \\(y =1\\) solve Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 when \\(a=3\\), and \\(b=c=6\\).2",

A theory enables us to predict how a ceteris paribus change in an exogenous variable affects all the endogenous variables.\nIt is straightforward to check that if \\(b\\) increases from 6 to 12 and \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) remain unchanged at 3 and 6 respectively, \\(x\\) would remain unchanged at 3 and \\(y\\) would increase from 1 to 2. (As an exercise, work out the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) from Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 for \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 12\\) and \\(c = 6\\).) Thus, our theory is able to predict how the endogenous variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), would behave if the exogenous variables—\\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)—change in some specified manner.\nTo see this in another way, note that Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 can be solved in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). In other words, one can write down the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that solve Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 as expressions involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Specifically, it is straightforward to check that Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 imply: \\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx &=& a \\\\\ny &=& \\frac{b}{c}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nAs an exercise, substitute \\(x=a\\) and \\(y=b/c\\) in Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 and show that the two sides of each equation become the same. This would verify my claim that these values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) do indeed solve Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2.\nWe can now complete our discussion of the utility of theories by noting that the solutions \\(x=a\\) and \\(y=b/c\\) imply that:\n\n\\(x\\) is directly related to \\(a\\) and unrelated to \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), and3\n\\(y\\) is directly related to \\(b\\), inversely related to \\(c\\)—that is, a ceteris paribus increase (respectively, decrease) in \\(c\\) causes a decrease (respectively, an increase) in \\(y\\)—and unrelated to \\(a\\).\n\nTable 6.1 reports these ceteris paribus effects in another format. This tabular format will be used frequently in future lectures.\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Predictions of the theory consisting of Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2. All variables named in the first column are exogenous and all variables listed in the first row are endogenous. Each cell in the table shows the relation between the exogenous variable and the endogenous variable aligned with the cell. The +/- symbols denote a direct/inverse relation and a zero denotes that there is no relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n+\n0\n\n\n\\(b\\)\n0\n+\n\n\n\\(c\\)\n0\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the theory we’ve been considering provides a full set of testable predictions about how its endogenous variables would behave for any given change in its exogenous variables. Once we have a theory that provides testable predictions, that’s when the hard work of actually testing those predictions begins. You’ll have to find historical data on \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(a\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)—this may require long hours in the library!—and check whether the data support the predictions in Table 6.1. If they don’t, you need to get cracking on a new theory with new variables and/or equations. On the other hand, if the data support the predictions in Table 6.1, you may have a publishable paper. At that point, you would need to be careful not to let the associated fame and fortune go to your head.",

    "text": "7.2 What Is Long-Run Analysis?\nIn the long-run analysis of equilibrium in the markets for goods, foreign exchange, and money, the following simplifying assumptions are made:\n\nFull Employment : all productive resources of the economy are assumed to be fully employed in the long run. That is, an economy’s real GDP (\\(Y\\)) is assumed to be equal to its potential real GDP (\\(Y^p\\)).4\nPerfect Foresight : people’s expectations are assumed to be accurate. Specifically, it is assumed that the actual future value of the foreign country’s currency (\\(E_f\\)) will be equal to the expected future value of the foreign country’s currency (\\(E^e_f\\)). Equivalently, it is assumed that the actual rate of growth of the value of the foreign country’s currency (\\(E_g\\equiv(E_f-E)/E\\)) is equal to the expected rate of growth of the value of the foreign country’s currency (\\(E^e_g\\equiv(E^e_f-E)/E\\)).5\n\nPerfect foresight is a simpler form of a common assumption in economics called rational expectations . Economists are aware of the fallibility of their forecasts.6 Nevertheless, it makes sense to assume that although expectations about the future value of a variable will at times exceed the actual outcome and at times be less than the actual outcome, they will on average be reasonably accurate. There is no a priori reason to believe that we will consistently overestimate (or, consistently underestimate) what the exchange value of the dollar will be in the future.\n\n7.2.1 Potential Real Gross Domestic Product\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Potential Output The red graph represents the U.S. Congressional Budget Office’s estimates of potential real GDP (in billions of chained 2000 dollars). The blue graph represents actual real GDP. The excess of potential GDP over actual GDP is referred to as the GDP gap. The gray bars in the figure represent the periods of recession in the U.S. economy. Actual GDP is typically less than potential GDP during recessions. Source: Data on real GDP was downloaded from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1 and data on potential real GDP was downloaded from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPPOT, both on November 25, 2012.\n\n\n\nAs was just mentioned, a country’s real GDP is assumed to be equal to its real potential GDP in the long run. Potential Real GDP is the real GDP that would be produced if the utilization of the resources of the economy were at normal levels. Actual real GDP, \\(Y\\), is less than potential real GDP when resources are under-utilized, as in a recession. On the other hand, if resource utilization is at abnormally high levels, as in a booming economy, actual real GDP could exceed potential real GDP.\nAn economy’s potential GDP depends on several factors. Potential GDP will be high if (a) the quantity and quality of the productive resources that the country is endowed with are high, (b) it can purchase from other countries at a low price the resources it does not have, (c) it has access to advanced technology, and (d) it has the economic policies and cultural institutions that encourage the efficient utilization of all resources. However, for the purposes of this book, \\(Y^p\\) will be regarded as exogenous, something as inscrutable as the weather.\nThe Congressional Budget Office, an arm of the United States Congress, publishes estimates of America’s potential real GDP.7 Potential GDP is a conceptual notion that cannot be directly observed. But that does not mean that it cannot be reliably estimated. See figure Figure 7.1 for a look at the CBO’s estimates of America’s potential real GDP.",

This action effectively fixes \\(E\\) at the central bank’s chosen value.\nTo see how this works, let us talk not about currencies but about something completely different: let us talk about wheat! Assume that Bill Gates announces that he is willing to buy and/or sell any amount of wheat for $15 a bushel.1 It is then straightforward to show that the market price will quickly become $15 per bushel. To see why, suppose the price was $18 per bushel before Bill’s announcement. As soon as Bill makes his announcement, wheat buyers, who quite understandably prefer the $15 price to the $18 price, would rush to buy Bill’s wheat at $15 per bushel and, as a result, all other wheat sellers would soon be forced to sell at Bill’s price. If, on the other hand, the price was $12 before Bill’s announcement, all sellers would sell their wheat to Bill unless other buyers start paying $15 as well. In short, the price of wheat will become whatever Bill wants it to be.\nIn the same way, the central bank of a nation can fix the nominal exchange rate of the domestic currency if it starts buying and selling the currency at some chosen price.",

To see why, suppose the US Federal Reserve announces that it will buy and/or sell dollars at 1.50 euros per dollar. If people rush to buy dollars from the Fed at that price, the Fed will have to print a fresh batch of dollars and pretty soon all those newly printed dollar bills will end up in the wallets of those who traded in their euros. That is, the US money supply (\\(M\\)), which, you may recall from Section 5.8.1, is the currency held by the public plus the value of their checking accounts, will increase. Similarly, if people choose to sell their dollars to the Fed in exchange for British pounds, the US money supply (\\(M\\)) will decrease because the dollars sold to the Fed are longer in peoples’ wallets. In short, the money supply will be whatever the people want it to be and not necessarily what the Federal Reserve wants it to be.\nIn other words, \\(M\\), the money supply, becomes an endogenous variable. That is, \\(M\\) will become a variable whose up and down movements our theory will have to explain. Just as \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(EX\\), \\(IM\\), etc. are variables whose movements our theory will have to predict, \\(M\\) will also be a variable whose movements our theory will have to predict.\nTo sum up, for the analysis of a fixed exchange rate system \\(E\\) will be regarded as exogenous and constant—that is, \\(E_f=E\\), which implies that \\(E_g\\) is not just exogenous, it is zero—and \\(M\\) will be regarded as endogenous.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Here’s an example of a fixed exchange rate system that turned into a flexible exchange rate system. For about a decade until July 2, 1997, the Thai baht was pegged at about 25 to the dollar. But a currency crisis developed in 1997 and it became impossible for the central bank of Thailand to continue to keep its obligation to pay one U.S. dollar to whoever offered 25 baht in payment. At that point the baht became a flexible (or, floating) currency. It rapidly lost value—note the sharp spike in the chart—reaching the low-point of 53 baht per dollar in January 1998. Although the baht has gradually regained some of its lost value it has still not reached its pre-crisis value of 25 baht per U.S. dollar. There will be more on currency crises in a later chapter.

    "text": "9.3 Net Exports\nRecall from Equation 5.8 that \\(Y=C+I+G+NX\\) is the condition that must be satisfied for the goods market to be in equilibrium. Therefore, \\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nNX&=&Y-C(Y-T)-I-G\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{9.2}\\] in long-run equilibrium.\nNotice that all the variables on the right hand side of this equation are exogenous. Therefore this equation tells us all that can be said about the long run behavior of \\(NX\\).\nFor example, what if there is a permanent increase in either \\(I\\) or \\(G\\) or both? It follows directly from Equation 9.2 that \\(NX\\) will decrease.\nIf, however, you are persuaded by the logic of Ricardian equivalence, which we saw in Section 5.3.1, then the analysis would be a lot more subtle. Suppose \\(G\\) has permanently increased by $100 a year. Section 5.3.1 implies that even though the government in this case has not raised taxes to pay for the increased spending, people may behave as if taxes have gone up by the same $100. In that case, \\(C\\) would fall. For a $100 increase in government spending that is perceived to be permanent, \\(C\\) would also fall by $100, the full extent of the perceived/feared increase in \\(T\\) and the actual increase in \\(G\\). And, therefore, the decline in \\(C\\) would cancel out the increase in \\(G\\) in Equation 9.2, leaving \\(NX\\) unchanged.\n\nThe effect of an increase in taxes is equally easy to figure out. When \\(T\\) increases, \\(C\\) decreases, as we saw in Section 9.2 above. Therefore, by Equation 9.2, \\(NX\\) will increase.\n\nFinally, what if there is a permanent increase in the domestic country’s potential real GDP (\\(Y^p\\)) by, say, $1.00? Consumption spending will increase—as we saw in Section 5.3 above—by the magnitude of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). And, as we saw in Section 5.3.1, the size of the MPC depends on whether the change in income is perceived to be permanent or temporary. Specifically, if the one-dollar increase in income is perceived to be permanent, \\(C\\) will also rise by one dollar and therefore, by Equation 9.2, \\(NX\\) will be unchanged. But when the one-dollar increase in income is perceived to be less than permanent, \\(C\\) will rise by a fraction of one dollar. So, \\(Y^p-C(Y^p-T)\\) will increase. Therefore, by Equation 9.2, \\(NX\\) will be increase.\nSo, what’s one to believe? If the permanent increase in \\(Y^p\\) is perceived to be permanent, \\(NX\\) is unaffected by the increase in \\(Y^p\\). But if people doubt the permanence of this increase in \\(Y^p\\), \\(NX\\) increases. It makes sense to split the difference and say that when potential real GDP increases, so does net exports, because in actual cases there may be no increase in potential real GDP that is perceived to be entirely permanent.\nTo sum up, what does our analysis say about the long-run behavior of a country’s trade balance or net exports? A country’s net exports is directly affected by its potential real GDP and its tax revenues; inversely affected by government spending and investment spending; and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These are ceteris paribus effects, and they are shown in the \\(NX\\)-column of Table 9.1.\n\n9.3.1 Policies to raise net exports\nThe important lesson of our analysis is that the only dependable way to achieve a long-run increase in net exports is through ‘fiscal austerity’ or ‘belt tightening’ by the country’s government. When government spending is reduced (\\(G\\downarrow\\)) and/or taxes are raised (\\(T\\uparrow\\)), net exports increases (\\(NX\\uparrow\\)).\nA surprising related point in that tariffs, which are taxes imposed only on imported goods and services, and other protectionist policies cannot affect a country’s net exports. It would be hard to make a cogent argument that tariffs would lead to an increase in \\(Y^p\\) or in \\(Y^p-C(Y^p-T)\\), or to a decrease in \\(I\\) or in \\(G\\). Therefore, it would be hard to make a persuasive argument that \\(NX=Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\\) would increase in the long run if tariffs or other protectionist measures are implemented.",

    "section": "9.4 Real Exchange Rate",
    "text": "9.4 Real Exchange Rate\nThe analysis of the long-run behavior of the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) depends on whether or not the law of one price is assumed to be true.2\n\n9.4.1 Under absolute purchasing power parity\n\nRecall from Section 5.6.4 that under the law of one price—also called absolute purchasing power parity—the real exchange rate must always be \\(q=1\\) and the relation between net exports and the real exchange rate is represented by a horizontal net exports curve such as the one shown in the right panel of Figure 5.2. In this case, the analysis of the long-run behavior of the real exchange rate is trivial: it will always stay at \\(q=1\\), nothing can make it budge.\nLet us, therefore, move on to the less restrictive case shown by the rising net exports curve in the left panel of Figure 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: This diagram shows how real exchange rates can change. In long-run equilibrium, both \\(NX=NX(q,Y^p-T)\\) and \\(NX=Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\\) must be true. Therefore, for the initial values \\(Y^p=Y^p_0\\) and \\(T=T_0\\), the equilibrium is at point \\(A\\). When either \\(T\\) increases or \\(Y^p\\) decreases, the upward-sloping net exports curve shifts right, as shown. When \\(T\\) increases, the vertical net exports curve also shifts right, but by more than the upward-sloping net exports curve does. As a result, the long run equilibrium moves from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\). This implies a direct effect of \\(T\\) on \\(q\\). When \\(Y^p\\) decreases, the vertical net exports curve shifts left. As a result, the long run equilibrium moves from \\(A\\) to \\(E\\). This implies a direct effect of \\(Y^p\\) on \\(q\\); they both move in the same direction. When either \\(I\\) or \\(G\\) increases, the upward-sloping net exports curve is unaffected and the vertical net exports curve shifts left, taking the equilibrium from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\). This shows that \\(I\\) and \\(G\\) have inverse effects on \\(q\\). No other exogenous variable affects \\(q\\). (Note that absolute purchasing power parity has not been assumed.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Without absolute purchasing power parity\n\n9.4.2.1 Two net exports curves: one upward-sloping, the other vertical\nRecall from Equation 5.6 that \\(NX=NX(q,Y-T)\\) is directly related to \\(q\\) and inversely related to \\(Y-T\\). For some given value of \\(Y-T\\), the direct effect of \\(q\\) on \\(NX\\) is shown as an upward-sloping net exports curve in the left panels of Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3 and yet again in Figure 9.1 in this chapter.3\nThese figures also show that a decrease in \\(Y^p\\) or an increase in \\(T\\) or, generally, a decrease in \\(Y-T=Y^p-T\\) shifts the upward-sloping net exports curve downward or to the right. A poorer country imports less and, therefore, sees its net exports increase at any given value of the real exchange rate.\nIn fact, we can be more specific about the size of this shift. Recall from Section 5.6.2 that if \\(Y-T\\) decreases by a dollar, both consumption (\\(C\\)) and imports (\\(IM\\)) will decrease, but the latter will decrease less than the former. In particular, \\(C\\) decreases by the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and \\(IM\\) decreases by less than the MPC. It therefore follows that when \\(Y^p-T\\) decreases by a dollar, \\(NX\\) will increase by less than the MPC, at any given value of the real exchange rate. In other words, when \\(Y^p-T\\) decreases by a dollar, the vertical net exports curve shifts right by a length smaller than the MPC.\nNow, as we saw in Section 9.3 above, the goods market’s equilibrium condition, \\(Y=C+I+G+NX\\), also tells us something about a country’s net exports. Specifically, \\(NX=Y-C(Y-T)-I-G\\) or, in long-run equilibrium, \\(NX=Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\\). As this equation expresses \\(NX\\) as entirely independent of \\(q\\), it can be graphically shown as the vertical net exports curve in Figure 9.1. It is vertical because changes in \\(q\\) have no effect on \\(NX=Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\\). Of course, if \\(Y^p\\) or \\(T\\) or \\(I\\) or \\(G\\) changes in value, so will \\(NX\\) and the vertical net exports curve will shift.\nFor example, if either \\(I\\) or \\(G\\) increases by a dollar, \\(NX=Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\\) will decrease by a dollar and the vertical net exports curve will shift left by a dollar. If \\(T\\) increases by a dollar, \\(C\\) will decrease, not by the entire dollar’s increase in taxes but by a fraction—a fraction that was called the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in Section 5.3.1. As a result, \\(NX=Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\\) will increase by that same amount (the MPC). Therefore, when \\(T\\) increases by a dollar, the vertical net exports curve shifts right by a length equal to the MPC.\nFinally, if \\(Y^p\\) increases by a dollar, then \\(C(Y^p-T)\\) increases by the MPC. Therefore, \\(Y^p-C(Y^p-T)\\), which is simply the part of total income that is saved, will increase by \\(1-\\text{MPC}\\) dollars, which is equivalent to MPS dollars, where MPS stands for the marginal propensity to save—see Section 5.3.1. In short, when \\(Y^p\\) increases by a dollar, the vertical net exports curve shifts right by MPS dollars.\n\n\n9.4.2.2 Equilibrium\nNow, in long-run equilibrium, what we know about the factors that influence net exports (\\(NX=NX(q,Y^p-T)\\), the upward-sloping net exports curve) must be consistent with what the goods market’s equilibrium condition tells us about net exports (\\(NX=Y^p-C(Y^p-T)-I-G\\), the vertical net exports curve). Therefore, in Figure 9.1, the long-run equilibrium must be at \\(A\\), where the two net exports curves intersect. This pinpoints the long-run equilibrium level of the real exchange rate.\nAnd, as we know how the two net exports curve shift when there are changes in the magnitudes of the exogenous variables \\(Y^p\\), \\(T\\), \\(I\\), and \\(G\\), we will be able to predict how the real exchange rate is affected by these changes.\nFor example, as we saw in the previous section, if either \\(I\\) or \\(G\\) increases, the upward-sloping net exports curve is unaffected and the vertical net exports curve shifts left. Therefore, the long-run equilibrium in Figure 9.1 moves from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\), implying a decrease in \\(q\\). That is, increases in domestic spending either by businesses (\\(I\\uparrow\\)) or the government (\\(G\\uparrow\\)) boosts the relative demand for the domestic country’s products and thereby raises the relative price of those products or, equivalently, reduces the relative price of foreign goods (\\(q\\downarrow\\)).\nWe have also seen that if \\(T\\) increases by a dollar, the upward-sloping net exports curve shifts right by less than the MPC. On the other hand, we have also seen that the vertical net exports curve shifts right by a length equal to the MPC. Therefore, the long-run equilibrium in Figure 9.1 will move from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\), implying an increase in \\(q\\). That is, an increase in taxes (\\(T\\uparrow\\)) leads to a higher real exchange rate (\\(q\\uparrow\\)). This is intuitive: A rise in taxes squeezes domestic consumption, which reduces demand in the domestic economy. This reduces the relative price of domestic goods or, equivalently, raises the relative price of foreign-made goods, which is the real exchange rate.\nFinally, we have seen in the previous section that if \\(Y^p\\) decreases by a dollar, the upward-sloping net exports curve shifts right and the vertical net exports curve shifts left. Therefore, the long-run equilibrium in Figure 9.1 moves from \\(A\\) to \\(E\\), implying a decrease in \\(q\\). That is, as in the case of \\(T\\), a change in \\(Y^p\\) brings about a change in \\(q\\) in the same direction.\nAnd, again, this is intuitive. If a country becomes more productive (\\(Y^p\\uparrow\\)) its goods become relatively more plentiful in the world economy. This drives down the relative price of domestic goods or, equivalently, makes foreign-made goods relatively more expensive (\\(q\\uparrow\\)).\n\n\n\n9.4.2.3 Real Exchange Rate: Summary\nTo summarize, under absolute purchasing power parity, \\(q=1\\) in all situations and is, therefore, unaffected by changes in our exogenous variables. When absolute purchasing power parity is not applicable, in long run equilibrium, the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) is inversely affected by government spending (\\(G\\)) and business investment (\\(I\\)); directly affected by taxes (\\(T\\)) and potential output (\\(Y^p\\)); and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(q\\)-column of Table 9.1.\nIn Chapter 10, a less stringent version of absolute purchasing power parity—called relative purchasing power parity—is assumed. Relative purchasing power parity is the assumption that the real exchange rate is constant over time, though not necessarily equal to one—see Section 10.4. Given the results summarized in the previous paragraph, for the real exchange rate to be constant, either \\(I\\), \\(G\\), \\(T\\), and \\(Y^p\\) would have to be constant or—and this is an unlikely possibility—they would have to change in concert in such a way that they cancel each others’ effects on \\(q\\) and, therefore, leave the real exchange rate constant.\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: Macroeconomic Behavior of Real Variables in the Long Run. All variables named in the first column are exogenous and all variables listed in the first row are endogenous. Each cell in the table shows the relation between the exogenous variable and the endogenous variable aligned with the cell. The +/?/- symbols denote a direct/ambiguous/inverse relation. A blank cell denotes that there is no relation. Note that absolute purchasing power parity has *not been assumed. Under APPP, the last three columns would be gone and the rest of the table would be unaffected. Recall that \\(q\\) is constant at \\(q=1\\) under APPP. Moreover, the \\(EX\\) and \\(IM\\) columns would be gone too, as they would no longer make sense, being infinitely elastic at \\(q=1\\).",

In fact, I did not even mention any monetary variables before this paragraph. This is an instance of an idea with a long pedigree in economics called monetary neutrality: any change in the quantity of money in circulation (\\(M\\)) will not affect a real variable.\nWhile monetary neutrality is thought to be a good description of an economy in the long run, we will see that things are different in the short run. In the short run, \\(M\\) can be an important determinant of real variables such as \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(q\\), and \\(NX\\).\nNote, finally, that in this chapter I did not bring up the issue of whether the country has a flexible exchange rate system or a fixed exchange rate system. In other words, the exchange rate system has nothing to do with the long run behavior of real variables. Put yet another way, the long run analysis of real variables will have nothing useful to say if a country is debating what kind of exchange rate system to adopt: both systems have the same real consequences.",

Absolute purchasing power parity says that \\(q=1\\)—see Equation 5.7. That is, not only must the real exchange rate be constant, it must be equal to one. The argument behind absolute purchasing power parity—which was discussed in Section 5.6.3 —is typically regarded as theoretically interesting and even cogent, but factually shaky. On the other hand, relative purchasing power parity, a less stringent version of the same idea, is widely accepted. Relative purchasing power parity is the assumption that in the long run the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) is constant over time, though not necessarily equal to one.\nFor the rest of this chapter, I will assume relative purchasing power parity or, equivalently,3 \\[\nq_g=0.\n\\tag{10.2}\\]\nNow, this may sound like a contradiction, but please hear me out. The assumption that \\(q\\) is constant over time does not mean that \\(q\\) can never change. Take a look at Figure 10.1. Except for two fleeting moments in time—\\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\)—\\(q\\) is indeed constant. Of course \\(q\\) does change at \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\).

    "section": "10.8 A Flexible Exchange Rate System",
    "text": "10.8 A Flexible Exchange Rate System\nI will now try to describe the long-run behavior of nominal variables in an economy that has a flexible exchange rate system.\nRecall from Section 8.2 that in a flexible exchange rate system the nominal value of the foreign currency, \\(E\\), is endogenous and the quantity of money in the domestic economy, \\(M\\), is exogenous. It follows that \\(E_g\\), the rate of growth (or appreciation) of the price of the foreign currency, must also be endogenous, and \\(M_g\\), the growth rate of he quantity of money, must be exogenous.\n\n10.8.1 Inflation\nEquation 10.6 can be rewritten as \\[\n\\pi=M_g-Y^p_g.\n\\tag{10.7}\\]\nNote that \\(M_g\\) and \\(Y^p_g\\) are both exogenous. Therefore, this equation tells us all that can be said about the long-run inflation rate: \\(\\pi\\) is directly affected by \\(M_g\\), inversely affected by \\(Y^p_g\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables.5 In fact, the effects are one-for-one: If the growth in the money supply speeds up by two percentage points (or if the growth of GDP slows down by two percentage points), inflation will speed up by the same two percentage points.\nInflation, in the long run, is a race between money supply and real GDP. Imagine what would happen if the monetary authorities of a country decide one day to print massive quantities of currency and drop them all across the country from helicopters. Once they have recovered from the initial shock, the people will rush to grab the money as fast as they possibly can. Cash-strapped people would rush immediately to the mall to buy stuff. Others would deposit the money in their bank accounts. But their bank managers would, as soon as possible, lend the money out to borrowers, because banks make money by lending their depositors’ money at interest rates that are higher than what the depositors are being paid. So, one way or another, the helicopter money would end up in the hands of eager shoppers. But the cruel irony is that the amount of stuff available for people to buy has not changed; after all, the amount of labor, land, and other productive resources did not magically increase when the money rained down from the helicopters. Therefore, the people will end up spending more money on the same amount of goods, which is another way of saying that all that they will do is bid up the prices of goods!\nThe amount of goods produced and purchased will remain unaffected by the helicopter money. And, indeed, why would it? If it were possible to increase production by simply printing money and dropping it everywhere from helicopters, every country in the world would have easily attained a princely standard of living. The fact that there are many poor people and poor countries all over the world is proof that printing currency bills cannot lead to higher output. All it does is raise prices.\nOf course, \\(Y^p\\) could increase for other reasons, such as increases in the labor force, the accumulation of capital equipment, technological progress, etc. If real potential GDP increases at the annual rate of 3.5% and the money supply increases at the rate of 5.0%, then Equation 10.7 tells us that inflation will run at the annual rate of \\(5.0-3.5=1.5\\)%.\nNote that \\(Y^p_g\\), a real variable, does have an effect on \\(\\pi\\), a nominal variable. This illustrates the point made in my discussion of monetary neutrality in Section 10.1: real variables can be discussed without mentioning any nominal variables, but the reverse is not true.\nRecall from Section 10.7 above that \\(Y^p_g=0\\) must be assumed when relative purchasing power parity is assumed. In that case the rate of inflation is the same as the rate at which the quantity of money is increasing in the domestic economy: that is, \\(\\pi=M_g\\).\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Behavior of Nominal Variables Under Flexible Exchange Rates in the Long Run. All variables named in the first column are exogenous and all variables listed in the first row are endogenous. Each cell in the table shows the relation between the exogenous variable and the endogenous variable aligned with the cell. The +/?/- symbols denote a direct/ambiguous/inverse relation. A blank cell denotes that there is no relation. The \\(Y^p_g\\) row is meaningful only under absolute purchasing power parity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.8.2 Appreciation of the Nominal Exchange Rate\nBy using Equation 10.6, Equation 10.3 can be rewritten as \\[\nE_g=M_g-Y^p_g-\\pi^*.\n\\tag{10.8}\\]\nAs all three variables on the right-hand side of this equation are exogenous, this equation tells us all that can be said about the rate of appreciation of the foreign currency: \\(E_g\\) is inversely affected by \\(\\pi^*\\) and \\(Y^p_g\\), directly affected by \\(M_g\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(E_g\\)-column of Table 10.1.\n\n\n10.8.3 The Nominal Interest Rate\nUsing Equation 10.6, Equation 10.4 can be rewritten as \\[\nR=R^*-\\pi^*- Y^p_g+M_g.\n\\tag{10.9}\\]\nAgain, note that all variables on the right-hand side of this equation are exogenous. It follows that \\(R\\), the nominal interest rate, is directly affected by \\(R^*\\) and \\(M_g\\), inversely affected by \\(\\pi^*\\) and \\(Y^p_g\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(R\\)-column of Table 10.1.\n\n\n10.8.4 The Price Level\nEquation 10.5 and Equation 10.9 can be combined into: \\[\nP=\\frac {M}{L(R^*-\\pi^*- Y^p_g+M_g)\\cdot Y^p}.\n\\tag{10.10}\\]\nNote that the above equation expresses the long-run equilibrium price level entirely in terms of exogenous variables. Therefore, the above equation tells us all that can be said about the price level.\nRecall from Section 5.8.4 that \\(L\\) is inversely related to \\(R=R^*-\\pi^*- Y^p_g+M_g\\). Therefore, an increase in either \\(R^*\\) or \\(M_g\\) or both (or a decrease in either \\(\\pi^*\\) or \\(Y^p_g\\) or both) will raise \\(R\\), reduce \\(L\\), and, therefore, raise \\(P\\). It follows that the price level, \\(P\\), is directly affected by \\(M\\), \\(R^*\\) and \\(M_g\\), inversely affected by \\(Y^p\\), \\(Y^p_g\\), and \\(\\pi^*\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(P\\)-column of Table 10.1.\n\n\n10.8.5 The Nominal Exchange Rate\nEquation 4.1, which defines the real exchange rate, can be rewritten as \\[\nE=\\frac {q\\cdot P}{P^*}.\n\\tag{10.11}\\]\nConsider the exogenous variables \\(I\\), \\(G\\) and \\(T\\). A quick look at the previous section shows that they do not affect \\(P\\). Therefore, their effects on \\(E\\) would be identical to their effects on \\(q\\), which are described in Section 9.4 and shown in the \\(q\\)-column of Table 9.1. %Under absolute purchasing power parity, however, \\(q=1\\) always, which implies \\(E=P/P^*\\).\nThe foreign price level, \\(P^*\\), affects neither \\(q\\)—see Section 9.4 —nor \\(P\\)—see Section 10.8.4. It is then obvious from Equation 10.11 that \\(E\\) is inversely related to \\(P^*\\).\nAn increase in \\(R^*\\) or \\(M\\) or \\(M_g\\) or a decrease in \\(\\pi^*\\) or \\(Y^p_g\\) (or some combination of these changes) will increase \\(P\\), as we just saw in Section 10.8.4; have no effect on \\(q\\), according to Section 9.4; and have no effect on \\(P^*\\), which is exogenous anyway. Therefore, by Equation 10.11, \\(E\\) will increase.\n% Section 9.4 makes it clear that \\(Y^p_g\\), \\(M\\), and \\(M_g\\) do not affect \\(q\\). As \\(P^*\\) is exogenous, Equation 10.11 implies that \\(Y^p_g\\), \\(M\\), and \\(M_g\\) can affect \\(E\\) only through their effects on \\(P\\). According to Section 10.8.4, an increase in \\(M\\) or \\(M_g\\) or a decrease in \\(Y^p_g\\) will lead to an increase in \\(P\\), which, by Equation 10.11, will lead to an increase in \\(E\\).\nFinally, an increase in \\(Y^p\\) leads to an increase in \\(q\\) and a decrease in \\(P\\) and leaves \\(P^*\\), which is exogenous anyway, unchanged. Therefore, by Equation 10.11, the effect of \\(Y^p\\) on \\(E\\) is ambiguous.\nTo summarize, the nominal exchange rate, \\(E\\), is inversely affected by \\(I\\), \\(G\\), \\(P^*\\), \\(\\pi^*\\), and \\(Y^p_g\\); directly affected by \\(T\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(M\\), and \\(M_g\\); ambiguously affected by \\(Y^p\\); and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(E\\)-column of Table 10.1.\n\n\n10.8.6 The Future Value of the Nominal Exchange Rate\nCan we make any predictions about the future value of the nominal exchange rate (\\(E_f\\))?\nAs we saw in Section 2.3.1, the rate of appreciation of the nominal exchange rate is \\(E_g\\equiv (E_f-E)/E\\), which implies \\(E_f=(1+E_g)\\cdot E\\).\nNow, let us consider the long-run behavior of \\(E_g\\) and \\(E\\), as discussed in Section 10.8.2 and Section 10.8.5 and summarized in the \\(E\\) and \\(E_g\\) columns of Table 10.1. Note that there is no exogenous variable whose effect on \\(E_g\\) contradicts its effect on \\(E\\). Therefore, for every exogenous variable, its effect on \\(E\\) will be the same as its effect on \\(E_f=(1+E_g)\\cdot E\\). This is why the \\(E\\) and \\(E_f\\) columns of Table 10.1 are the same.\nTo summarize, the future value of the nominal exchange rate, \\(E_f\\), is inversely affected by \\(I\\), \\(G\\), \\(P^*\\), \\(\\pi^*\\), and \\(Y^p_g\\); directly affected by \\(T\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(M\\), and \\(M_g\\); ambiguously affected by \\(Y^p\\); and unaffected by all other exogenous variables.\nThis completes my discussion of the long-run behavior of nominal variables in an economy that has a system of flexible exchange rates. The results are summarized in Table 10.1.",

    "text": "10.9 A Fixed Exchange Rate System\nI will now try to describe the long-run behavior of the nominal variables in an economy that has a system of fixed exchange rates.\nRecall from Section 8.1 that in a fixed exchange rate system the nominal value of the domestic currency, \\(E\\) is exogenous (because, after all, it is fixed!) and the quantity of money, \\(M\\), is endogenous. It follows that \\(M_g\\), the growth rate of he quantity of money, is endogenous as well.\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: Behavior of Nominal Variables Under Fixed Exchange Rates in the Long Run. All variables named in the first column are exogenous and all variables listed in the first row are endogenous. Each cell in the table shows the relation between the exogenous variable and the endogenous variable aligned with the cell. The +/?/- symbols denote a direct/ambiguous/inverse relation. A blank cell denotes that there is no relation. The \\(Y^p_g\\) row is meaningful only under absolute purchasing power parity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.9.1 Inflation\nAs the value of \\(E\\) is exogenous and fixed, it follows that \\[\nE_f=E\\qquad\\Longleftrightarrow\\qquad E_g=0.\n\\tag{10.12}\\]\nEquation 10.3, which is derived from the long-run assumption of relative purchasing power parity, can then be rewritten as \\[\n\\pi=\\pi^*.\n\\tag{10.13}\\]\nThat is, the domestic rate of inflation, \\(\\pi\\), is equal to the foreign rate of inflation, \\(\\pi^*\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. This is shown in the \\(\\pi\\)-column of Table 10.2.\n\n\n10.9.2 The Nominal Interest Rate\nEquation 10.4 and Equation 10.13 together imply \\[\nR=R^*.\n\\tag{10.14}\\]\nThat is, the domestic nominal interest rate, \\(R\\), is equal to the foreign nominal interest rate, \\(R^*\\), and is unaffected by all other exogenous variables. This is shown in the \\(R\\)-column of Table 10.2.\nEquation 10.13 and Equation 10.14 show how strongly a country gets tied up with the country whose currency its own currency is fixed to. If China fixes the value of its currency, the yuan, to, say, 25 American cents, one yuan would essentially become equivalent to a quarter dollar and the difference between people who carry yuans in their wallets and those who carry dollars would be the same as the difference between those who carry 25 cent coins in their wallets and those who carry one dollar bills. In other words, when the yuan is fixed to the dollar, there is no genuine difference any more between the two currencies, which is why the inflation rates and interest rates in America and China would become equal, just as they are equal in New York and Texas and California.\n\n\n10.9.3 The Price Level\nEquation 4.1, which defines the real exchange rate, can be rewritten as \\[\nP=\\frac {E\\cdot P^*}{q}.\n\\tag{10.15}\\]\nAs both \\(E\\) and \\(P^*\\) are exogenous, it follows that the exogenous variables \\(G\\), \\(I\\), \\(T\\), and \\(Y^p\\) will affect \\(P\\) in a way that is precisely the opposite of how Section 9.4 says they affect \\(q\\).\n\nRecall from Section 9.4 that \\(E\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(\\pi^*\\) and \\(P^*\\), being nominal variables, do not affect \\(q\\), the real exchange rate. Therefore, Equation 10.15 implies that \\(P\\) is directly affected by \\(P^*\\) and \\(E\\) and unaffected by \\(R^*\\) and \\(\\pi^*\\).\nTo summarize, \\(P\\) is directly affected by \\(G\\), \\(I\\), \\(P^*\\), and \\(E\\), inversely affected by \\(T\\) and \\(Y^p\\) , and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(P\\)-column of Table 10.2.\n\n\n10.9.4 The Quantity of Money\nEquation 10.5 and Equation 10.14 together imply: \\[\nM=L(R^*)\\cdot P\\cdot Y^p.\n\\tag{10.16}\\]\nTherefore, for all exogenous variables other than \\(R^*\\) and \\(Y^p\\), their effects on \\(M\\) are the same as what Section 10.9.3 says are their effects on \\(P\\).\nAccording to Section 5.8.4, \\(L\\) decreases when \\(R(=R^*)\\) increases. Moreover, we saw in Section 10.9.3 that an increase in \\(R^*\\) has no effect on \\(P\\). Equation 10.16 then implies that \\(M\\) must decrease when \\(R^*\\) increases.\nWe also saw in Section 10.9.3 that an increase in \\(Y^p\\) decreases \\(P\\). Therefore, it folows from Equation 10.16 that the effect of an increase in \\(Y^p\\) on \\(M\\) is ambiguous.\nTo summarize, \\(M\\) is directly affected by \\(G\\), \\(I\\), \\(P^*\\), and \\(E\\); inversely affected by \\(T\\) and \\(R^*\\); ambiguously affected by \\(Y^p\\); and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(M\\)-column of Table 10.2.\n\n\n10.9.5 Growth Rate of the Quantity of Money\nEquations Equation 10.6 and Equation 10.13 together imply: \\[\nM_g=\\pi^*+ Y^p_g.\n\\tag{10.17}\\]\nAs both \\(\\pi^*\\) and \\(Y^p_g\\) are exogenous, it follows that \\(M_g\\) is directly affected by \\(\\pi^*\\) and \\(Y^p_g\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables.\nThis completes my discussion of the long-run behavior of nominal variables in an economy that has a system of fixed exchange rates. The results are summarized in Table 10.2.\n\n\n10.9.6 The Sustainability of a Fixed Exchange Rate System\n\nBefore we end this discussion of long-run international macroeconomics under fixed exchange rates, let us go back to Section 8.1.1 of Chapter 8 and remind ourselves of how a fixed exchange rate system works.\nThe domestic central bank announces that it is willing to buy/sell currencies at the rate of \\(\\bar{E}\\) units of the domestic currency per unit of the foreign currency. Soon after this policy is announced, the market equilibrium value of the foreign currency becomes equal to the domestic central bank’s target rate—\\(E=\\bar{E}\\)—and the domestic central bank achieves its wish to control \\(E\\).\nUnfortunately, as was pointed out in Section 8.1.1, the domestic central bank will no longer be able to exert control over the domestic money supply (\\(M\\)), which then becomes an endogenous variable. When people show up at the domestic central bank’s door with bundles of foreign currency and ask for \\(\\bar{E}\\) units of the domestic currency for every unit of foreign currency, the domestic central bank will have to print new currency and hand it over to the public. There will, therefore, be a simultaneous increase in the domestic money supply (\\(M\\)) and the domestic central bank’s reserves of the foreign currency, which I will denote \\(F\\).\nOn the other hand, when people approach the domestic central bank, offering \\(\\bar{E}\\) units of the domestic currency and seeking one unit of the foreign currency in exchange, the domestic central bank must reach into its foreign currency reserves and hand over the promised amount to the public. Therefore, in this case, there will be a simultaneous decrease in both \\(M\\) and \\(F\\).\nIn short, in a fixed exchange rate system, domestic money supply (\\(M\\)) and domestic reserves of foreign currency (\\(F\\)) must move together in lockstep.\nThis brings us to Section 10.9.4 above. There we saw that the long-run equilibrium value of \\(M\\) could decrease for a number of reasons—for example, decreases in domestic investment (\\(I\\)) and/or foreign prices (\\(P^*\\)). Now, a money supply decrease of magnitude \\(\\Delta M\\) would have to be accompanied by a decrease in foreign currency reserves of magnitude \\(\\Delta F=\\Delta M/\\bar{E}\\). This is because the people will show up at the domestic central bank’s door, hand over \\(\\Delta M\\) units of the domestic currency, and ask for \\(\\Delta F\\) units of the foreign currency in return.\nBut what if the central bank just does not have \\(\\Delta F\\) units of the foreign currency?\nIn that case, unless a benevolent foreign government or an international financial institution such as the International Monetary Fund steps in with a loan, the domestic central bank will be forced to take back its promise to exchange \\(\\bar{E}\\) units of the domestic currency for each unit of foreign currency. It will have to say, “Sorry, but the deal is off” and put an end to the fixed exchange rate system. The economy would thereafter operate under flexible exchange rates.\nAside from the prospect of being rescued by a foreign-currency loan from a foreign government or the IMF, our discussion in Section 10.9.4 shows another way out: the government can come to the central bank’s rescue and either raise government spending (\\(G\\uparrow\\)) or cut taxes (\\(T\\downarrow\\)). As can be checked from the \\(M\\)-column of Table 10.2, these policy measures will exert upward pressure on \\(M\\) and, thereby, reverse the initial decline in \\(M\\) that was caused by decreases in \\(I\\) and/or \\(P^*\\). This would remove the threat to the fixed exchange rate system.\nHowever, such expansionary fiscal policies—big increases in government spending and/or big cuts in taxes—will almost surely require deficit financing or, simply, borrowing by the government. And at a time of grave crisis, when the country’s central bank is about to renege on its promise, the credibility of the country’s government may be low and people may not be willing to lend it money. In that case, this country’s fixed exchange rate system would be hard to rescue.\nWe can learn more about the robustness of a country’s fixed exchange rate system by looking at the long-run equilibrium growth rate of its money supply. This is given in Equation 10.17: \\(M_g=\\pi^*+ Y^p_g\\). Although this will most likely be positive, a negative value cannot be ruled out. That would mean continuous and simultaneous decreases in both \\(M\\) and \\(F\\). And, again, if the domestic central bank does not have enough foreign currency reserves to begin with, \\(F\\) could quickly evaporate, in which case the central bank would have to put an end to its fixed exchange rate system.\nTo summarize the discussion so far, the sustainability of a fixed exchange rate system depends crucially on whether the domestic central bank has a big enough stash of foreign currency. One way for the domestic central bank to ensure this is to adopt what is called a currency board system. In this case the domestic central bank adopts a fixed exchange rate system only when its foreign currency reserves (\\(F\\)) are at least \\(1/\\bar{E}\\) times the currency held by the public.\nTo see why this will ensure that the central bank will never run out of foreign currency, let’s try a numerical example. Suppose the amount of domestic currency currenctly held by the public is $10 trillion. Suppose the domestic central bank announces that it is willing to exchange currencies at the rate of $2.00 for : this sets \\(\\bar{E}=2\\). If domestic reserves of foreign currency are currently \\((1/2)\\times 10 =\\) trillon, then even if all $10 trillion currently held by the public are brought to the central bank by people clamoring for euros in return, the central bank would still have enough euros to keep its promise. It will not run out of foreign currency reserves.\nI will continue my discussion of the sustainability of fixed exchange rate systems and their susceptibility to speculative currency crises in a later chapter.",

    "text": "10.10 Conclusion: Flexible or Fixed?\nNow that we have looked at the long-run behavior of nominal economic variables under both flexible and fixed exchange rate systems, which system is better?\nA lot comes down to the extent to which a country can neutralize the effects on its economy of things that may be happening in another country.\nIf it is very important for a country to be able to keep its inflation rate stable and unaffected by economic shocks originating abroad, then a flexible exchange rate system would be preferable. Equation 10.7 shows that \\(\\pi=M_g-Y^p_g\\) under a flexible system and Equation 10.13 shows that \\(\\pi=\\pi^*\\) in a fixed system. Under a fixed exchange rate system, a country’s inflation rate is joined at the hip to the foreign country’s inflation.\nOn the other hand, under a fixed exchange rate system, the exchange rate is, well, fixed, whereas under a flexible exchange rate system traders engaged in international transactions may have to grapple with a lot of uncertainty over the exchange rate.\nIn the end, it all comes down to the relative importance of inflation stability versus exchange rate stability for a particular country.",

    "text": "11.1.1 Recessions and Booms\nTo see why, recall from Section 7.2 that long-run analysis assumes full employment. That is, an economy’s real gross domestic product (\\(Y\\)) is assumed to be equal to its potential real gross domestic product (\\(Y^p\\)). In other words, recessions and booms are ruled out by assumption. This short-cut is fine for long-run analysis, but not for short-run analysis.\nSudden and sharp declines in \\(Y\\) do happen. Therefore, such recessions need to be explained. A theory that assumes \\(Y=Y^p\\) can “explain” a sharp decline in \\(Y\\) by arguing that there must have been a sharp decline in \\(Y^p\\). But such an explanation is unpersuasive. After all, as we saw in Section 7.2.1, the factors that determine a country’s potential GDP—the quantity and quality of productive resources, the level of technology, and the nature of the country’s institutions—typically do not go up and down like a yoyo. Therefore, for short-run analysis, the only way to reconcile a stable \\(Y^p\\) with a volatile \\(Y\\) is by rejecting the \\(Y=Y^p\\) assumption and admitting that recessions (\\(Y&lt;Y^p\\)) and booms (\\(Y&gt;Y^p\\)) may happen.\n\n\n11.1.2 Price Rigidity\nA related question is this: What might make \\(Y\\) less than \\(Y^p\\)? If an economy is capable of producing $14 trillion worth of goods and services per year under normal circumstances, why would it not produce that amount? Why would it produce less? Or more? The key reason is that prices tend to be sticky (or ‘rigid’ or ‘inflexible’) in the short run.\nIn the long run, changes in the price level (\\(P\\)) tend to yank \\(Y\\) towards \\(Y^p\\) whenever the two diverge. In recessions (\\(Y&lt;Y^p\\)), unemployment rises. The availability of many unemployed workers seeking jobs tends to make labor cheaper. This induces businesses to hire additional workers and boost production. To sell the additional output, firms must reduce prices, and indeed they can afford to do so because the wages they pay their workers have fallen. So, a recovery occurs and \\(Y\\) again becomes equal to \\(Y^p\\) thanks to the flexibility of wages and prices. This ability of the price level to respond flexibly to a recession and restore full employment is what makes the \\(Y=Y^p\\) assumption reasonable in long-run analysis.\nUnfortunately, this smooth self-adjusting process tends not to work in the short run. In the short run, wages may not fall in a recession—the presence of many unemployed job seekers notwithstanding—because of contracts that were agreed upon among businesses and workers or because of several other reasons. Wages are sticky in the short run. And, the stickiness of wages typically means sticky prices as well. Moreover, prices may be sticky for reasons unrelated to the stickiness of wages. And this price stickiness could make it difficult for businesses to hire more workers during a recession because the additional output produced by the newly hired workers will not sell if prices cannot be reduced.\n\n\n11.1.3 Expectations\nAnother distinction between long-run analysis and short-run analysis has to do with expectations. As we saw in Section 7.3, short-run analysis assumes that \\(E_f^e\\), which is what the value of the foreign currency at a future date is currently expected to be, is equal to \\(E_{fLR}\\), which is the long-run equilibrium value of \\(E_f\\). Moreover, \\(E_{fLR}\\) is assumed to be exogenous. Long-run analysis, on the other hand, assumes perfect foresight: \\(E_f^e=E_f\\). This is equivalent to the \\(E_f^e=E_{fLR}\\) assumption of short-run analysis except that \\(E_{fLR}\\) is endogenous in long-run analysis.\nThe distinction is hard to explain, but let me try. For both long-run analysis and short-run analysis we assume \\(E_f^e=E_{fLR}\\). That is, we assume that people’s expectations about \\(E_f\\) will coincide with its actual long-run equilibrium value. In long-run analysis, as we saw in Section 10.8.6, \\(E_f\\) is an endogenous and unknown variable—like \\(E\\), \\(R\\), \\(P\\), \\(\\pi\\), etc.—whose equilibrium value is determined by the theory itself; that is why Table 10.1 has an entire column listing how the various exogenous variables affect the long-run equilibrium value of \\(E_f\\). Short-run analysis, on the other hand, is unable to determine the value of \\(E_{fLR}\\). It treats \\(E_{fLR}\\) as a mysterious, exogenous variable that dances to its own tune. It has to seek the assistance of long-run analysis to understand what makes \\(E_{fLR}\\) increase or decrease.\nThe distinction between the long-run and short-run assumptions about expectations is key to understanding why the short-run effects of a temporary change in an exogenous variable are different from the short-run effects of a permanent change in that same exogenous variable. A temporary change in an exogenous variable—for example, a temporary cut in taxes (\\(T\\downarrow\\))—cannot be expected to affect the future. Therefore, it makes sense to assume that people’s expectations about the future (\\(E_f^e\\)) will be unaffected. As a result, the short-run analysis of a temporary tax cut can proceed on the assumption that \\(E_f^e\\) has not changed. The short-run analysis of a permanent tax cut is a more complex matter. Table 10.1, which summarizes the long-run analysis of a flexible exchange rate system, says that a permanent tax cut will reduce \\(E_{fLR}\\). Knowing this, the people will rationally revise \\(E_f^e\\) downward as soon as the permanent tax cut is announced. Therefore, the short-run effect of a permanent tax cut is the combined effect of a temporary tax cutand a decrease in \\(E_f^e\\).\nWe will discuss this issue further in the next two chapters.",

    "section": "11.2 Short-Run Equilibrium in the Goods Market",
    "text": "11.2 Short-Run Equilibrium in the Goods Market\nWe are now ready to do what we did in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10, but under the short-run assumptions that both \\(P\\) and \\(E_f^e\\) are exogenous. Unfortunately, short-run analysis is not as straightforward as long-run analysis. The arguments will have to be built up brick-by-brick and a full view of the theory will not be visible for quite a while. You will have to be patient.\nThe foundation of the theory will once again consist of the equations for equilibrium in the goods, money, and foreign currency markets that we saw in Chapter 5. So, it might be a good idea for you to review Equation 5.8, Equation 5.9, and Equation 5.13.\n\n11.2.1 The Aggregate Expenditure Curve\n\nRecall from Section 5.1 that equilibrium in the goods market requires that the demand for domestically produced goods be equal to the output of such goods, as in Equation 5.8. This crucial equation is reproduced below, with Equation 4.1 or \\(q=E\\cdot P^*/P\\) substituted for \\(q\\): \\[\n\\fbox{$\\displaystyle Y=C(Y-T)+I+G+NX\\left(\\frac{E\\cdot P^*}{P},Y-T\\right).$}\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nNote that \\(Y\\) is the only endogenous variable in the above equation. As we saw in Section 7.1 that \\(T\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(P^*\\) are always exogenous in these lectures. Moreover, as we saw above, \\(P\\) is exogenous in short-run analysis. And, finally, \\(E\\) is exogenous because we are considering fixed exchange rates in this chapter. That leaves \\(Y\\) as the only endogenous variable in Equation 11.1. This implies that an analysis of this equation will tell us all that can be said about the short-run behavior of \\(Y\\) under fixed exchange rates.3\nThe analysis of Equation 11.1 will now proceed, not algebraically but graphically. (Indeed, you will see that a lot of short-run analysis is graphical.)\nAs was mentioned in the first paragraph of this section, the right-hand side of Equation 11.1 represents the total expenditure on domestically produced goods. This is usually referred to as aggregate expenditure or \\(AE\\). The goods market equilibrium condition can then be stated simply as \\(Y=AE\\). \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(NX\\) are called the *components of aggregate expenditure.4\nWe saw in Section 5.3 that a country’s consumption spending (\\(C\\)) is represented by the consumption function \\(C=C(Y-T)\\). We assume that \\(C\\) is directly related to income (\\(Y\\)) and inversely related to taxes (\\(T\\)). Figure 5.1 showed the consumption function graphically as a rising consumption curve. Moreover, Figure 5.1 also shows that the consumption curve shifts downward when taxes increase. The consumption curve of Figure 5.1 makes a return appearance in figure Figure 11.1 in this chapter.\nAs we saw in Section 5.4 and Section 5.5, business investment (\\(I\\)) and government spending (\\(G\\)) are assumed to be exogenous constants; in particular, they do not go up or down when \\(Y\\) increases or decreases. In figure Figure 11.1 they are therefore represented by horizontal lines.\nIf we stack the \\(C\\), \\(I\\), and \\(G\\) curves one on top of the other, we get the \\(C+I+G\\) curve in figure Figure 11.1. \\(C+I+G\\) is commonly referred to as gross domestic purchases, the total purchases of domestic households, firms, and government.\nWe saw in Section 5.6.3 that a country’s net exports are given by \\(NX=NX(q,Y-T)\\) and that net exports are directly related to the real exchange rate (\\(q\\)) and to \\(T\\), and inversely related to \\(Y\\). Figure Figure 5.2 showed this graphically. Its right panel, in particular, shows a net exports curve that slopes downward as \\(Y\\) increases and shifts downward when either \\(q\\) or \\(T\\) falls. This net exports curve makes a return appearance in figure Figure 11.1 here.\nIf we stack the \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(NX\\) curves vertically, we get the aggregate expenditure (\\(AE=C+I+G+NX\\)) curve in figure Figure 11.1. At any particular value of real GDP (\\(Y\\)), the height of the \\(AE\\) curve shows the total demand for domestically produced goods.\n\n\n11.2.2 Slope of the Curve\nNote that the \\(AE\\) curve is upward sloping. Would it be a mistake to draw it as a downward-sloping curve instead? Recall that the \\(I\\) and \\(G\\) curves are horizontal, the \\(C\\) curve is upward sloping, and the \\(NX\\) curve is downward sloping. When these curves are stacked vertically to construct the \\(AE\\) curve, couldn’t the result be a downward-sloping curve?\nWell, no. A quick look at Section 5.6.2 will settle the issue. When income (\\(Y\\)) increases, so does consumption (\\(C\\)). Only a part of that additional consumption is imported. That is, imports increase, but by less than the magnitude of the increase in consumption. As exports are unaffected by \\(Y\\), net exports (\\(NX\\)) will decrease, but again by less than the magnitude of the increase in \\(C\\). Therefore, \\(AE=C+I+G+NX\\) will increase when \\(Y\\) increases, which means that the \\(AE\\) curve in figure Figure 11.1 has been quite properly shown to be upward sloping.\nNote that \\(NX\\) can be positive or zero or negative. At \\(Y=Y_A\\) in figure Figure 11.1, \\(NX=0\\), which is why the gross domestic purchases (\\(C+I+G\\)) curve and the aggregate expenditure (\\(AE=C+I+G+NX\\)) curve have the same height (that is, they intersect) at \\(Y=Y_A\\). At lower incomes (\\(Y&lt;Y_A\\)), \\(NX&gt;0\\) and, therefore, \\(AE\\) exceeds \\(C+I+G\\). At higher incomes (\\(Y&gt;Y_A\\)), \\(NX&lt;0\\) and, therefore, \\(AE\\) is less than \\(C+I+G\\).\n\n\n11.2.3 The 45 Line\nFigure Figure 11.1 also includes a 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line through the origin. To see the utility of this seemingly useless line, note that at any value of \\(Y\\), the height of the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line is equal to the value of \\(Y\\). For instance, at \\(Y=Y_A\\), the height up to point \\(B\\) on the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line is equal to \\(Y_A\\), whereas the height up to point \\(A\\) on the \\(AE\\) curve exceeds \\(Y_A\\). As the height of the \\(AE\\) curve denotes the magnitude of \\(AE=C+I+G+NX\\), it follows that at \\(Y=Y_A\\), \\(Y&lt;AE\\), which violates Equation 11.1, the equilibrium condition for the goods market. So, simply by noting that the \\(AE\\) curve is higher than the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line at \\(Y=Y_A\\), one can conclude that it would be unwise to predict that \\(Y=Y_A\\) in short-run equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Here we see how the short-run equilibrium value of \\(Y\\) can be graphically determined if the aggregate expenditure curve (\\(AE\\)) is known. The \\(AE\\) curve is constructed by the vertical summation of the consumption (\\(C\\)), investment (\\(I\\)), government spending (\\(G\\)), and net exports (\\(NX\\)) curves. The goods market is in equilibrium when \\(Y=AE\\)—that is, when the \\(AE\\) curve intersects the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 The Keynesian Cross\nNow that we have ruled out \\(Y_A\\), could the short-run equilibrium value of \\(Y\\) be \\(Y_D\\) instead? At \\(Y=Y_D\\), a comparison of points \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) shows that the height of the \\(AE\\) curve is less than the height of the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line. Therefore, \\(Y&gt;AE\\) at \\(Y=Y_D\\). So, \\(Y_D\\) can’t be the short-run equilibrium GDP either.\nSo far, we have tried twice to spot the equilibrium value of \\(Y\\) and have failed miserably. At \\(Y_A\\), the \\(AE\\) curve was higher than the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line. At \\(Y_D\\), the \\(AE\\) curve was lower than the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line. So, it makes sense to try point \\(H\\) where the two curves cross. At \\(Y=Y_{SR}\\), the heights of the two curves are same, implying \\(Y=AE\\). Therefore, the short-run equilibrium value of real GDP must be \\(Y=Y_{SR}\\).\nThat’s it, we’ve finally got it! We have established that if a country’s \\(AE\\) curve is known, its short-run equilibrium GDP is the value of \\(Y\\) at which the \\(AE\\) curve crosses the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line.\nAs you will soon see, this graphical trick will be very useful in predicting how GDP is affected by changes in various exogenous variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: An upward shift of the aggregate expenditure curve leads to an increase in GDP in the short run. Such an upward shift of the \\(AE\\) curve could be caused by an increase in \\(G\\) or \\(I\\) or \\(E\\) or \\(P^*\\), or by a decrease in \\(T\\) or \\(P\\), or by some combination of these changes. Therefore, in the short run and under fixed exchange rates, \\(Y\\) is directly affected by \\(G\\), \\(I\\), \\(E\\), and \\(P^*\\); inversely affected by \\(T\\) and \\(P\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.5 Gross Domestic Product: How the \\(AE\\) curve can shift\n\nIn figure Figure 11.2, there are two aggregate expenditure curves, \\(AE^1\\) and \\(AE^2\\), as well as the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line that first appeared in figure Figure 11.1. Given that the short-run equilibrium level of income is that at which the \\(AE\\) curve crosses the 45\\(^{\\circ}\\) line, it follows that equilibrium income must be \\(Y_{SR}^1\\) when aggregate expenditure is \\(AE^1\\) and \\(Y_{SR}^2\\) when aggregate expenditure is \\(AE^2\\). In other words, the higher the \\(AE\\) curve, the higher the short-run equilibrium income.\nTherefore, if we knew what makes the aggregate expenditure curve rise, we would know what makes income increase.\nLuckily, it is straightforward to figure out what makes the \\(AE\\) curve rise (or fall). Recall from Section 11.2.1 that the \\(AE\\) curve is the vertical sum of the \\(C\\), \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(NX\\) curves. Therefore, anything that causes any of these curves to shift upwards will also shift the \\(AE\\) curve upwards.\nWe saw in Section 5.3 and figure Figure 5.1 that a decrease in taxes (\\(T\\downarrow\\)) shifts the \\(C\\) curve up. An increase in households’ wealth—possibly fueled by a rise in share prices or home prices—would have the same effect, as would a general surge in optimism. Therefore, any combination of these factors would shift the \\(AE\\) curve upwards as well.\nA surge in optimism among entrepreneurs will cause business investment to increase. This would raise the \\(I\\) curve and, therefore, the \\(AE\\) curve.\nA shift in government policy—brought about, say, by the election of a new president—could boost government spending. This would raise the \\(G\\) curve and, consequently, the \\(AE\\) curve.\nAs was pointed out in Figure 5.2, an increase in either taxes (\\(T\\uparrow\\)) or the real exchange rate (\\(q\\uparrow\\)) shifts the net exports curve upwards. Of course, we know from Equation 4.1 that \\(q=E\\cdot P^*/P\\). Therefore, we can say that the \\(NX\\) and \\(AE\\) curves would shift upwards if \\(E\\) increases or \\(P^*\\) increases or \\(P\\) decreases. In all these cases, the \\(NX\\) curve rises and, therefore, so does the \\(AE\\) curve.5\nThere is a slight problem, however, with the effect of taxes. A tax cut (\\(T\\downarrow\\)) raises the \\(C\\) curve and lowers the \\(NX\\) curve, simultaneously. What’s the overall effect on these conflicting effects on the \\(AE\\) curve? As this issue was addressed indirectly in Section 11.2.2, I don’t want to rehash the argument here. Long story short, when taxes fall, consumption increases and so do imports, but by a smaller amount. As a result, the \\(C\\) curve shifts up and the \\(NX=\\hbox{exports}-\\hbox{imports}\\) shifts down, but the increase in \\(C\\) exceeds the decrease in \\(NX\\). Therefore, the \\(AE\\) curve shifts up.\nTo summarize, in an economy that has a fixed exchange rate system, the aggregate expenditure curve shifts upwards—and, therefore, short-run equilibrium income (\\(Y\\)) rises—if there is a ceteris paribus decrease in \\(T\\) or \\(P\\), or there is a ceteris paribus increase in \\(I\\) or \\(G\\) or \\(E\\) or \\(P^*\\), or there is some combination of those changes. Changes in other exogenous variables will have no effect. This is shown in the \\(Y\\)-column of Table 11.1.\n\n\n11.2.6 Consumption\nWhat can we say about the short-run behavior of consumption spending under fixed exchange rates? For example, how will \\(C\\) react if \\(T\\) increases? Recall that \\(C=C(Y-T)\\). We have just seen that \\(Y\\) decreases when \\(T\\) increases. This decrease in \\(Y\\) coupled with the increase in \\(T\\) implies that disposable income (\\(Y-T\\)) will decrease. Therefore, \\(C\\) must decrease.\nChanges in the other exogenous variables—\\(I\\), \\(G\\), \\(P^*\\), \\(E\\), and \\(P\\)—cannot affect \\(T\\), which is exogenous. Therefore, their effects on \\(C=C(Y-T)\\) will be the same as their effects on \\(Y\\). That is why the \\(C\\) and \\(Y\\) columns of Table 11.1 are the same for these five exogenous variables.6\nTo summarize, in an economy that has a fixed exchange rate system, in the short-run equilibrium, \\(C\\) is directly affected by \\(I\\), \\(G\\), \\(P^*\\), and \\(E\\), inversely affected by \\(T\\) and \\(P\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(C\\)-column of Table 11.1.\n\n\n11.2.7 Net Exports\nTo analyze the behavior of net exports, I will make use of the behavioral expression \\(NX=NX(E\\cdot P^*/P,Y-T)\\) and the goods market equilibrium condition, which yields \\(NX=Y-C(Y-T)-I-G\\).7\nFirst, consider an increase in \\(I\\) or an increase in \\(G\\) or a decrease in \\(T\\). The \\(Y\\)-column of Table 11.1 assures us that \\(Y\\) will increase. Therefore, disposable income (\\(Y-T\\)) will increase too. Moreover, \\(E\\cdot P^*/P\\) will be unaffected as \\(E\\), \\(P^*\\), and \\(P\\) are all exogenous and, therefore, cannot be affected by changes in other exogenous variables. Therefore, \\(NX=NX(E\\cdot P^*/P,Y-T)\\) must decrease, as net exports fall when rising disposable income leads to surging imports—see Section 5.6.\nSecond, check from Section 11.2.5 of from the \\(Y\\)-column of Table 11.1 that an increase in \\(R^*\\) has no effect on \\(Y\\). Moreover, it cannot affect \\(E\\), \\(P\\), \\(P^*\\), and \\(T\\). Therefore, it cannot have any effect on \\(NX=NX(E\\cdot P^*/P,Y-T)\\).\nFinally, consider an increase in \\(E\\) or an increase in \\(P^*\\) or a decrease in \\(P\\). The real exchange rate (\\(q\\equiv E\\cdot P^*/P\\)) increases. As we saw in Section 11.2.5 and as the \\(Y\\)-column of Table 11.1 reminds us, an increase in the relative price of foreign goods (that is, \\(q\\uparrow\\)) will raise the aggregate expenditure curve and cause \\(Y\\) to increase. The simultaneous increase of \\(q\\) and \\(Y-T\\) will have conflicting effects on \\(NX=NX(E\\cdot P^*/P,Y-T)\\): the rise in \\(q\\) increases \\(NX\\) and the rise in \\(Y-T\\) decreases it.\nTo get away from this confusing ambiguity, let us look at \\(NX=Y-C(Y-T)-I-G\\) instead. Recall from Section 5.3.1 that when \\(Y\\) increases, \\(C\\) increases but by a smaller amount. Therefore, \\(Y-C\\) increases. As \\(E\\), \\(P^*\\), and \\(P\\) are exogenous, they have no effect on \\(I\\) and \\(G\\), which are exogenous too. Therefore, we conclude that if there is an increase in \\(E\\) or an increase in \\(P^*\\) or a decrease in \\(P\\), \\(NX=Y-C(Y-T)-I-G\\) must increase.\nTo summarize, in an economy that has a fixed exchange rate system, in the short-run equilibrium, a country’s net exports (\\(NX\\)) is directly affected by \\(T\\), \\(P^*\\), and \\(E\\), inversely affected by \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(P\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(NX\\)-column of Table 11.1.\n\n11.2.7.1 Tariffs\nThe effect of the nominal price of foreign goods (\\(P^*\\)) on net exports can help us understand the effect of protectionist measures such as tariffs , even though tariffs have not been formally included in our equations. When tariffs are imposed on imported goods, the effect is the same as that of an increase in \\(P^*\\), which, as can be checked from the \\(P^*\\) row of Table 11.1, leads to increases in both \\(Y\\) and \\(NX\\). Therefore, at least in the short run and under fixed exchange rates, a tariff may not be a bad idea for an economy that is suffering from either a recession or a huge trade deficit.\nHowever, the theory being discussed here is simple and needs a “don’t try this at home” warning. It assumes that a country can embrace protectionist policies such as tariffs without provoking retaliation. In the real world, a country that imposes tariffs will very quickly find its trade partners implementing retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\n\nTable 11.1: Macroeconomic Behavior under Fixed Exchange Rates in the Short Run.

    "text": "11.4 The Quantity of Money: Short-Run Equilibrium in the Money Market\nRecall from Section 5.8.5 that equilibrium in the money market requires the equality of money demand and money supply, which is represented by Equation 5.9. With the necessary substitution of \\(R=R^*\\) from Equation 11.2 above, we get \\[\n\\fbox{$\\displaystyle M=L(R^*)\\cdot P\\cdot Y.$}\n\\tag{11.3}\\]\nRecall from Section 8.1.1 that, in a fixed exchange rate system, a country’s money supply is an endogenous variable. Equation 11.3, therefore, has two exogenous variables, \\(R^*\\) and \\(P\\), and two endogenous variables, \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\). However, as we already know how various exogenous variables affect \\(Y\\)—see Section 11.2.5 above—and as both \\(R^*\\) and \\(P\\) are exogenous, we can easily figure out how various exogenous variables affect the entire right-hand side of Equation 11.3. This in turn will tell us how \\(M\\) is affected.\nConsider, for example, the effect of an increase in \\(R^*\\) on \\(M\\). First, the increase in \\(R^*\\) leads to an increase in \\(R\\), according to Equation 11.2. This reduces \\(L\\), the people’s desire for cash (or, liquid) assets, because, when interest rates are higher, people want more of interest-earning assets (that is, bonds) and less of the zero-interest-earning asset (that is, cash); see Section 5.8.4.2. Secondly, the increase in \\(R^*\\) has no effect on \\(P\\), because one exogenous variable (\\(R^*\\)) cannot affect another (\\(P\\)). Finally, a quick look at the \\(Y\\)-column of Table 11.1 shows that \\(R^*\\) does not affect \\(Y\\). Putting all this together, we see that when \\(R^*\\) increases \\(M\\) must decrease—an inverse relationship.\nAs both \\(P\\) and \\(R^*\\) are exogenous, an increase in \\(P\\) will not affect \\(L(R^*)\\) in Equation 11.3. But, as the \\(Y\\)-column of Table 11.1 shows, \\(Y\\) will decrease. Therefore, an increase in \\(P\\) may or may not increase \\(P\\cdot Y\\) in \\(M=L(R^*)\\cdot P\\cdot Y\\). In other words, the effect of \\(P\\) on \\(M\\) is ambiguous.\nChanges in the other exogenous variables—\\(I\\), \\(G\\), \\(T\\), \\(E\\), and \\(P\\)—cannot affect either \\(P\\) or \\(R^*\\), which are exogenous. Therefore, their effects on \\(M=L(R^*)\\cdot P\\cdot Y\\) must be the same as their effects on \\(Y\\), which have been discussed above in Section 11.2.5. This implies that, for these five exogenous variables, the \\(Y\\)- and \\(M\\)-columns in Table 11.1 must be identical.\nTo summarize, in an economy that has a fixed exchange rate system, in the short-run equilibrium, the domestic money supply (\\(M\\)) is directly affected by \\(I\\), \\(G\\), \\(E\\), and \\(P^*\\), inversely affected by \\(T\\) and \\(R^*\\), ambiguously affected by \\(P\\), and unaffected by all other exogenous variables. These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(M\\)-column of Table 11.1.\nThis completes my discussion of short-run equilibrium in an economy that has a fixed exchange rate system, except for a few concluding observations.",

    "text": "11.5 Conclusion\nNote from the \\(E\\), \\(P\\), and \\(P^*\\) rows of Table 11.1 that monetary neutrality—see Section 10.1 —does not hold in the short run; \\(E\\), \\(P\\), and \\(P^*\\) are all nominal variables, and yet they clearly do affect real variables such as \\(Y\\) and \\(NX\\).\nRecall from Section 9.3 and Section 9.7 that an important lesson of our long-run analysis was that an important way for a country to increase its net exports is contractionary fiscal policy (\\(G\\downarrow\\) or \\(T\\uparrow\\)), which is also referred to as “fiscal austerity” or “belt tightening”. We now see that contractionary fiscal policy is also effective in the short run in an economy that has a fixed exchange rate system.\nWhat’s new in this chapter is that tariffs and other protectionist measures, although useless in the long run, can play a useful role in the short run in an economy that has a fixed exchange rate system. At least that’s the implication of our simplified theory. The analysis of tariffs can get very complicated very quickly in the real world if we keep in mind that when one country imposes tariffs on other countries’ goods, the affected countries will not stand idly by; they will retaliate with tariffs of their own.",

    "section": "12.2 Asset Markets",
    "text": "12.2 Asset Markets\nRecall from Section 5.9.2 that equilibrium in the foreign exchange market is represented by the uncovered interest parity equation, Equation 5.13, which is \\[\n\\fbox{$\\displaystyle R=R^*+\\frac{E^e_f}{E}-1.$}\n\\tag{12.2}\\]\nIt follows in a straightforward manner that the interest rate (\\(R\\)) will remain unchanged if \\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(E\\) are unchanged. And, \\(R\\) will increase if one or more of only the following changes occur: \\(R^*\\uparrow\\), \\(E_f^e\\uparrow\\), and \\(E\\downarrow\\).\nAlso, recall from Section 5.8.5 that the money market is in equilibrium when money supply (\\(M\\)) is equal to money demand (\\(L(R)\\cdot P\\cdot Y\\)): \\[\n\\fbox{$M=L(R)\\cdot P\\cdot Y.$}\n\\tag{12.3}\\]\nThe two equations above can be merged into the following equation representing simultaneous equilibrium in both the money and foreign exchange markets: \\[\nM=L\\left(R^*+\\frac{E^e_f}{E}-1\\right)\\cdot P\\cdot Y.\n\\tag{12.4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: For the asset markets to be in equilibrium, if the exogenous variables \\(M\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(P\\) stay unchanged, any increase in \\(E\\) must be accompanied by a decrease in \\(Y\\). This inverse relation between the exchange rate and output is called the \\(AA\\) curve. The \\(AA\\) curve will shift to the right if \\(M\\uparrow\\), \\(P\\downarrow\\), \\(R^*\\uparrow\\), or \\(E_f^e\\uparrow\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.1 The AA Curve: slope\nThe equation above has two endogenous variables (\\(E\\) and \\(Y\\)) and four exogenous variables (\\(M\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(P\\)). Suppose the magnitudes of the exogenous variables are known. Further, suppose the asset markets are in equilibrium—that is, Equation 12.4 is satisfied—for the values \\(E=E_1\\) and \\(Y=Y_1\\). Would this pair of values for \\(E\\) and \\(Y\\) be the only such pair at which Equation 12.4 is satisfied? Certainly not: there are many others.\nIf \\(R^*\\) and \\(E_f^e\\) stay unchanged and the value of the foreign currency increases (\\(E\\uparrow\\)), Equation 12.2 implies that the interest rate must decrease (\\(R\\downarrow\\)). And, we know from Section 5.8.4.2, that this must increase people’s desire for liquidity (\\(L(R)\\uparrow\\)): when the interest rate decreases people get rid of some of their interest-paying assets (such as bonds) and hold on to non-interest-paying cash instead. Now, note that Equation 12.3 implies \\(Y=M/(L(R)\\cdot P)\\). As both \\(M\\) and \\(P\\) are unchanged and \\(L(R)\\) has increased, \\(Y\\) must decrease if the asset markets are to remain in equilibrium. Therefore, we see that, if the exogenous variables (\\(M\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(P\\)) are unchanged, and if the asset markets are in equilibrium when \\(E=E_1\\) and \\(Y=Y_1\\), then the asset markets will also be in equilibrium for some higher value of \\(E\\)—such as \\(E=E_2\\) in Figure 12.2 —and some lower value of \\(Y\\)—such as \\(Y=Y_2\\) in Figure 12.2.\nThat is, if initially the asset markets are in equilibrium and \\(E=E_1\\) and \\(Y=Y_1\\) as in point \\(A\\) in Figure 12.2, this will not be the only asset markets equilibrium outcome. Assuming \\(M\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(P\\) are fixed, there will exist other equilibrium in which \\(E=E_2\\) and \\(Y=Y_2\\) as in point \\(B\\). The collection of all such outcomes that keep the asset markets in equilibrium is the \\(AA\\) curve. As there is an inverse relation between the values of \\(E\\) and \\(Y\\) that keep the asset markets in equilibrium when \\(M\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(P\\) are fixed, the \\(AA\\) curve is downward-sloping, as in Figure 12.2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: The short-run equilibrium under flexible exchange rates is at \\(Q\\), the intersection of the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.2 The AA Curve: shifts\nLet us return to point \\(B\\) in Figure 12.2, where the asset markets are in equilibrium. Let us consider what would happen if the money supply increases (\\(M\\uparrow\\)), the other exogenous variables (\\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(P\\)) remain unchanged. Is it possible that at the new equilibrium the exchange rate is still at \\(E=E_2\\)? We know from Equation 12.2 that the interest rate (\\(R\\)) will not change. Therefore, \\(L(R)\\) will not change. Therefore, as Equation 12.3 implies \\(Y=M/(L(R)\\cdot P)\\), the increase in money supply will lead to an increase in output (\\(Y\\uparrow\\)). That is, when \\(M\\) increases, there indeed would exist a new equilibrium such that \\(E=E_2\\), as before, but with an output that’s higher than before. In other words, the increase in \\(M\\) pushes the outcome from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\).\nFollowing the same line of reasoning, it can be shown that if domestic prices fall (\\(P\\downarrow\\)), the other exogenous variables (\\(R^*\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(M\\)) remain unchanged, and the exchange rate stays unchanged at \\(E=E_2\\), then neither \\(R\\) nor \\(L(R)\\) will change, and, consequently, output will increase (\\(Y\\uparrow\\)).\nNext, what would happen if the foreign interest rate increases (\\(R^*\\uparrow\\)), the other exogenous variables (\\(M\\), \\(E_f^e\\), and \\(P\\)) remain unchanged, and the exchange rate also stays unchanged at \\(E=E_2\\). We know from Equation 12.2 that the interest rate must increase (\\(R\\uparrow\\)). Therefore, as we saw in the opening paragraph of this section, the people’s desire for liquidity must decrease (\\(L(R)\\downarrow\\)). Therefore, as \\(Y=M/(L(R)\\cdot P)\\), it follows that output must increase (\\(Y\\uparrow\\)).\nThe previous paragraph could be repeated word-for-word, but with \\(R^*\\) and \\(E_f^e\\) changing places, to establish that an increase in the current expectation of the future value of the foreign currency (\\(E_f^e\\uparrow\\)) must also lead to an increase in output (\\(Y\\uparrow\\)), assuming \\(M\\), \\(R^*\\), \\(P\\), and \\(E\\) are unchanged.\nIn short, if \\(E\\) stays unchanged, then, for the asset markets to remain in equilibrium, \\(Y\\) must increase if some subset of the following ceteris paribus changes occurs: \\(M\\uparrow\\), \\(P\\downarrow\\), \\(R^*\\uparrow\\), and \\(E_f^e\\uparrow\\). In other words, assuming the economy is initially at an equilibrium outcome represented by point \\(B\\) in Figure 12.2, the new equilibrium would be at a point such as \\(C\\). And, as the \\(AA\\) curve represents all possible asset markets equilibrium outcomes, if the equilibrium is no longer at point \\(B\\), the \\(AA\\) curve can no longer be \\(AA_1\\). As the equilibrium has moved from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\), the \\(AA\\) curve must also have moved from \\(AA_1\\) to \\(AA_2\\). In other words, we have established that the \\(AA\\) curve will shift to the right if one or more of only the following changes occur—\\(M\\uparrow\\), \\(P\\downarrow\\), \\(R^*\\uparrow\\), and \\(E_f^e\\uparrow\\). These effects are summarized in the \\(AA\\)-column of Table 12.1.",

    "section": "12.3 Short-Run Equilibrium",
    "text": "12.3 Short-Run Equilibrium\nA crucial feature of the analysis presented here is the assumption that all three markets—goods, money, and foreign exchange—must be in equilibrium simultaneously. Therefore, point \\(A\\) in Figure 12.3 cannot represent equilbrium because none of our three markets are in equilibrium when \\(E=E_{ABC}\\) and \\(Y=Y_A\\). Point \\(A\\) lies neither on the \\(DD\\) curve, which includes all outcomes that represent equilibrium in the goods market, nor on the \\(AA\\) curve, which includes all outcomes that represent equilibrium in the asset markets, meaning the money and foreign exchange markets.\nSimilarly, neither \\(B\\) nor \\(C\\) in Figure 12.3 can be the short-run equilibrium. At \\(B\\), which is on the \\(DD\\) curve but not on the \\(AA\\) curve, the goods market is in equilibrium, but not the asset markets. At \\(C\\), the asset markets are in equilibrium but the goods market is not.\nIt is only at \\(Q\\)—that is, where the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) curves intersect—that all three markets are in equilibrium. In other words, only when the exchange rate is \\(E=E_{SR}\\) and real GDP is \\(Y=Y_{SR}\\) does short-run equilibrium prevail.

    "section": "12.4 Predictions",
    "text": "12.4 Predictions\nWe are now close to working out the full short-run consequences of temporary changes in our exogenous variables. We can now apply (a) our understanding that the intersection of the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) curves determines the equilibrium values of \\(Y\\) and \\(E\\), and (b) our knowledge of how changes in certain exogenous variables can shift the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) curves, to make predictions about the effects of those exogenous changes on all our endogenous variables, including \\(Y\\) and \\(E\\).\n\n12.4.1 Fiscal Policy\nLet us begin by analysing the effects of expansionary fiscal policy, which refers to either an increase in government spending (\\(G\\uparrow\\)) or a cut in taxes (\\(T\\downarrow\\)) or both. We know from Section 12.1.2 and Section 12.2.2 that, as a result of these changes in fiscal policy, the \\(DD\\) curve will shift to the right and the \\(AA\\) curve will be unaffected. Therefore, the effects of expansionary fiscal policy can be shown by panel (a) of Figure 12.4. It follows that, real income will rise (\\(Y\\uparrow\\)) and the domestic currency will appreciate (\\(E\\downarrow\\)).\nTherefore, disposable income must increase (\\(Y-T\\uparrow\\)). And, therefore, consumption spending must increase (\\(C=C(Y-T)\\uparrow\\)).\nExpansionary fiscal policy cannot affect the domestic and foreign price levels (\\(P\\) and \\(P^*\\)), which are exogenous. Therefore, the decrease in \\(E\\) implies a decrease in the real exchange rate (\\(q\\equiv E\\cdot P^*/P\\downarrow\\)). The decrease in the real exchange rate, which implies that foreign goods have become relatively cheaper, and the increase in disposable income, which leads to more imports, must both lead to a decrease in net exports (\\(NX=NX(q, Y-T)\\downarrow\\)).4\nFinally, note that expansionary fiscal policy cannot affect \\(R^*\\) and \\(E_f^e\\), which are exogenous. This, plus the decrease in \\(E\\), together imply, as we saw in Section 12.2, that the domestic interest rate must increase (\\(R\\uparrow\\)).\nThe reader can verify that the effects of an increase in business investment (\\(I\\uparrow\\)) are identical to the effects of an increase in government spending.\nTo summarize, if only some subset of these exogenous changes—\\(I\\uparrow\\), \\(G\\uparrow\\), \\(T\\downarrow\\)—occur, then \\(Y\\uparrow\\), \\(E\\downarrow\\), \\(C\\uparrow\\), \\(NX\\downarrow\\), \\(q\\downarrow\\), and \\(R\\uparrow\\), as shown in the rows for \\(I\\), \\(G\\), and \\(T\\) in Table 12.1.\nNote that these results provide an intellectual basis for the use of expansionary fiscal policy during a recession. Cutting government spending and raising taxes may represent a rare and admirable sense of responsibility and restraint in a government, but such otherwise praiseworthy behavior may not be a good idea when an economy is facing short-run trouble.\n\n\n12.4.2 Foreign Price Level\nThe effects of an increase in foreign prices (\\(P^*\\uparrow\\)) are also shown by panel (a) of Figure 12.4. Specifically, we know from Section 12.1.2} and Section 12.2.2 or from the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) columns of Table 12.1 that the \\(DD\\) curve shifts right and the \\(AA\\) curve is unaffected. Therefore, \\(Y\\uparrow\\) and \\(E\\downarrow\\), as they did under expansionary fiscal policy. As taxes, which are exogenous, are unaffected, \\(Y-T\\uparrow\\), which further implies \\(C=C(Y-T)\\uparrow\\).\nWe know from Section 5.3 that when disposable income increases, consumption increases, but by a smaller amount. Therefore, \\(Y-T-C\\) must increase, which implies that \\(Y-C\\) must increase when \\(P^*\\) increases, as the exogenous \\(T\\) is unaffected. Now recall that the goods market’s equilibrium condition, \\(Y=C+I+G+NX\\), implies \\(NX=Y-C-I-G\\). As the rise in the foreign price level (a) cannot affect \\(I\\) and \\(G\\), which are exogenous, and (b) leads to an increase in \\(Y-C\\), we can conclude that net exports must increase (\\(NX\\uparrow\\)).\nWe have just seen that when \\(P^*\\) increases, \\(NX\\) and \\(Y-T\\) both increase. Now recall from Section 5.6.3 that net exports (\\(NX=NX(q, Y-T)\\)) are directly related to \\(q\\) and inversely related to \\(Y-T\\). Given that \\(Y-T\\) has increased, how could \\(NX\\) have increased? The only possible explanation is that the real exchange rate must have increased, and to such an extent that \\(NX\\) increased in spite of the increase in \\(Y-T\\).\nFinally, note that higher foreign prices cannot affect \\(R^*\\) and \\(E_f^e\\), which are exogenous. This, plus the decrease in \\(E\\), together imply, as we saw in Section 12.2, that the domestic interest rate must increase (\\(R\\uparrow\\)).\nTo summarize, if there is a ceteris paribus increase in \\(P^*\\), then \\(E\\downarrow\\), \\(Y\\uparrow\\), \\(C\\uparrow\\), \\(NX\\uparrow\\), \\(q\\uparrow\\), and \\(R\\uparrow\\). These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(P^*\\)-row of Table 12.1.\n\n\n12.4.3 The Interest Rate\nNow let us consider increases in \\(R^*\\) or \\(E_f^e\\) or both. From Section 12.1.2 and Section 12.2.2 or from the \\(DD\\)- and \\(AA\\)-columns of Table 12.1, one can check that the \\(DD\\) curve will be unaffected and the \\(AA\\) curve will shift to the right. These shifts are shown in panel (d) of Figure 12.4, which makes clear that real output and the exchange rate will both increase (\\(Y\\uparrow\\) and \\(E\\uparrow\\)). The increase in \\(E\\) and the fact that the exogenous prices, \\(P\\) and \\(P^*\\), are unaffected by changes in \\(R^*\\) and/or \\(E_f^e\\), together imply that the real exchange rate must have increased (\\(q\\equiv E\\cdot P^*/P\\uparrow\\)). And, the increase in output must lead to an increase in consumption (\\(C=C(Y-T)\\uparrow\\)), as taxes, which are exogenous, are unaffected by \\(R^*\\) or \\(E_f^e\\).\nMoreover, as we saw a few paragraphs ago, \\(Y-C\\) increases when \\(Y\\) increases and \\(T\\) is unchanged. Therefore, net exports, which we saw a few paragraphs back are given by \\(NX=Y-C-I-G\\), must increase.\nNow recall the money market’s equilibrium condition is given by Equation 12.3 above or \\(M=L(R)\\cdot P\\cdot Y\\). This implies \\(L(R)=M/(P\\cdot Y)\\). As \\(M\\) and \\(P\\), which are exogenous, are unchanged, and \\(Y\\) has increased, it follows that \\(L(R)\\) has decreased. But we know from Section 5.8.4.2 that \\(L(R)\\) is inversely related to \\(R\\): when interest rates are high, people do not want to hang on to liquid cash; they’d rather buy interest-paying bonds. Therefore, the decrease in \\(L(R)\\) implies that \\(R\\) has increased.\nTo summarize, if there is a ceteris paribus increase in \\(R^*\\) or in \\(E_f^e\\), then \\(E\\uparrow\\), \\(Y\\uparrow\\), \\(C\\uparrow\\), \\(NX\\uparrow\\), \\(q\\uparrow\\), and \\(R\\uparrow\\). These ceteris paribus effects are shown in the \\(R^*\\)- and \\(E_f^e\\)-rows of Table 12.1 as a long row of plus (\\(+\\)) signs.\n\n\n12.4.4 Monetary Stimulus\nRecall that a nation’s central bank can run the printing presses at any time, and use the newly printed cash to buy financial assets such as government bonds from John or Jane Q. Public, as a result of which there would be a quick increase in \\(M\\). What would be the short run effects of a temporary increase in the quantity of money in circulation?\nThe first two paragraphs of the previous section will work just fine if all mentions of \\(R^*\\) or \\(E_f^e\\) are replaced by \\(M\\). Therefore, it is easy to check that \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(NX\\), \\(q\\), and \\(E\\) will all increase as a result of an increase in the quantity of money.\nThe only difference is that increases in \\(R^*\\) or \\(E_f^e\\) lead to higher domestic interest rates whereas an increase in \\(M\\) leads to lower domestic interest rates (\\(R\\downarrow\\)). To see why, recall from Equation 12.2 that \\(R=R^*+(E^e_f/E)-1\\). An increase in \\(M\\) depreciates the domestic currency (\\(E\\uparrow\\)) and has no effect on other exogenous variables such as \\(R^*\\) and \\(E_f^e\\). Therefore, it follows that the domestic interest rate decreases.\nTo summarize, if a nation’s money supply increases—and all other exogenous variables remain unchanged—then \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(NX\\), \\(q\\), and \\(E\\) will all increase, and \\(R\\) will decrease. This is shown in the \\(M\\)-row of Table 12.1.\nThe direct effect of \\(M\\) on \\(Y\\) is a hugely important result that is the intellectual basis of the argument in favor of expansionary monetary policy in a recession. Indeed, it is now standard practice for central banks to boost the money supply whenever a recession hits.\n\n\n12.4.5 The Domestic Price Level\nFinally, we need to work out how our endogenous variables respond to an increase in the domestic price level. (I have saved the toughest nut for the last!)\nA quick glance at Section 12.1.2 and Section 12.2.2 or at the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) columns of Table 12.1 shows that both the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) curves must shift leftward when \\(P\\) increases. These shifts are portrayed by panels (b) and (c) in Figure 12.4. It is clear that output decreases (\\(Y\\downarrow\\)).\nBut the effect on the exchange rate is ambiguous: \\(E\\) increases in panel (b), in which \\(DD\\) shifts more than \\(AA\\), but decreases in panel (c) in which \\(DD\\) shifts less than \\(AA\\). In other words, although an increase in the domestic price level affects the equilibrium outcome in all three markets, if the effect on the goods market is very strong compared to the effects on the money and foreign currency markets, then the value of the foreign currency increases. On the other hand, if the effect on the asset markets is stronger, then the exchange rate decreases.\nAlso, recall from Equation 12.2 that \\(R=R^*+(E^e_f/E)-1\\). As an increase in \\(P\\) cannot affect other exogenous variables such as \\(R^*\\) and \\(E_f^e\\), and as the effect on \\(E\\) is ambiguous, the effect on the domestic interest rate must be ambiguous as well.\nWe have seen several times already that any change in \\(Y\\) leads to similar changes in \\(C\\) and \\(Y-C\\), provided taxes are unaffected. Therefore, as an increase in \\(P\\) cannot affect other exogenous variables such as \\(T\\), the decrease in \\(Y\\) that we saw two paragraphs back must lead to decreases in \\(C\\) and \\(Y-C\\). We have also seen on several occasions above that the goods market’s equilibrium condition \\(Y=C+I+G+NX\\) implies \\(NX=Y-C-I-G\\). Therefore, the decrease in \\(Y-C\\) implies a decrease in net exports as well, given that \\(I\\) and \\(G\\), which are exogenous, are unaffected.\nNote that when \\(P\\) increases, \\(NX\\) and \\(Y-T\\) both decrease. Now recall from Section 5.6.3 that net exports (\\(NX=NX(q, Y-T)\\)) are directly related to \\(q\\) and inversely related to \\(Y-T\\). Given that \\(Y-T\\) has decreased, how on earth could \\(NX\\) have decreased also? The only possible explanation is that the real exchange rate must have decreased, and decreased to such an extent that \\(NX\\) decreased in spite of the decrease in \\(Y-T\\).5\nTo summarize, if the domestic price level increases and all other exogenous variables stay unchanged, then \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(NX\\), and \\(q\\) must all decrease. The effects on \\(E\\) and \\(R\\) are ambiguous.\nThis completes my analysis of the short-run effects of temporary changes in exogenous variables in an economy that has flexible exchange rates. The results are summarized in Table 12.1.\n\n\n\nTable 12.1: Macroeconomic Behavior under Flexible Exchange Rates in the Short Run: temporary changes. All variables named in the first column are exogenous and all variables listed in the first row are endogenous. Each cell in the table—except those in the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) columns—shows the relation between the exogenous variable and the endogenous variable aligned with the cell. The +/?/- symbols denote a direct/ambiguous/inverse relation. A blank cell denotes that there is no relation. Each cell in the \\(DD\\) and \\(AA\\) columns shows how the two curves shift, if at all, when the exogenous variable aligned with that cell increases.",

We have seen in other contexts before that contractionary fiscal policy (\\(G\\downarrow\\) and/or \\(T\\uparrow\\)) consistently leads to higher net exports. It is, therefore, a relief to see the same result in this chapter.\nAlthough casual commentators often suggest an increase in tariffs on imported goods as a way to increase net exports, we have seen in Chapter 9} that tariffs do not affect net exports in the long run. An increase in tariffs does raise net exports in the short run under fixed exchange rates, as we saw in the last chapter. This chapter’s analysis shows the same effect is true under flexible exchange rates as well.",

    "text": "13.1.1 The Primary Effect\nWe begin by recalling—from Section 12.4.1 or the \\(G\\)-row of table Table 12.1 —the short-run effects of a temporary increase in government spending. The \\(DD\\) curve, which represents all pairs of values of real output (\\(Y\\)) and the exchange rate (\\(E\\)) that keep the goods market in equilibrium, shifts to the right. The \\(AA\\) curve, which represents all pairs of values of real output (\\(Y\\)) and the exchange rate (\\(E\\)) that keep the money and foreign currency markets in equilibrium, stays put. As a result, there are increases in output, consumption, and the interest rate (\\(Y\\uparrow\\), \\(C\\uparrow\\), \\(R\\uparrow\\)), and decreases in net exports, the nominal exchange rate, and the real exchange rate (\\(NX\\downarrow\\), \\(E\\downarrow\\), \\(q\\downarrow\\)).\nNeedless to say, these effects are temporary. A temporary increase in government spending will, by definition, soon be reversed. Therefore, \\(G\\) will return to its original level. The \\(DD\\) curve will return to its original position, and all endogenous variables will return to their original values.\nOn the other hand, when the increase in government spending is permanent, the \\(DD\\) curve will shift permanently to the right. Therefore, the temporary changes in \\(Y\\), \\(C\\), \\(R\\), \\(NX\\), \\(E\\), and \\(q\\) that we saw two paragraphs back will now be permanent.\nI will call these effects of a permanent increase in government spending the primary effect. The primary effect of a permanent increase in government spending is the same as the short-run effect of a temporary increase in government spending that we saw in the \\(G\\)-row of table Table 12.1.\nIn general, the primary short-run effect of a permanent increase in any given exogenous variable \\(X\\) on any endogenous variable \\(Z\\) is identical to the short-run effect of a temporary increase in \\(X\\) on \\(Z\\), and this effect can be seen in the \\(X\\)-row and \\(Z\\)-column of Table 12.1.\n\n\n13.1.2 The Secondary Effect\nSo far, it looks as if distinguishing between permanent and temporary changes in an exogenous variable is a waste of time. It looks as if a permanent increase in \\(G\\) has the same effects as a temporary increase in \\(G\\), except that the effects of former are permanent and the effects of the latter are temporary.\nBut actually there’s more to the story. A permanent increase in \\(G\\) will reduce the long-run equilibrium value of \\(E_f\\), which will lead to an immediate decrease in \\(E_f^e\\), which will have additional short-run effects of its own (on our endogenous variables).\nFeeling dizzy? Let’s go over this step by step.\nThe \\(G\\)-rows of tables Table 9.1 and Table 10.1 summarize the long-run effects of a permanent increase in government spending. Note in particular that the long-run equilibrium value of the future value of the foreign currency decreases (\\(E_f\\downarrow\\)). Now recall from Section 7.3 that in short-run analysis it is assumed that the expected value of \\(E_f\\) is equal to its long-run equilibrium value: that is, \\(E_f^e=E_{fLR}\\). Therefore, it follows that, as soon as the permanent increase in government spending occurs, people will realize that \\(E_f\\) will eventually fall, and, consequently, they will revise downward their expectation of the future value of the foreign currency (\\(E_f^e\\downarrow\\)).\nWill this decrease in \\(E_f^e\\) have further effects on our endogenous variables? Indeed, it will. Recall from Section 12.4.3 and the \\(E_f^e\\)-row of table Table 12.1 that a temporary decrease in \\(E_f^e\\) will temporarily affect various endogenous variables: \\(Y\\downarrow\\), \\(C\\downarrow\\), \\(R\\downarrow\\), \\(NX\\downarrow\\), \\(E\\downarrow\\), and \\(q\\downarrow\\). Therefore, a permanent decrease in \\(E_f^e\\) will have the same effects, only this time the effects will be permanent.\nI will call these effects of a permanent increase in government spending the secondary effect, because it works indirectly by influencing people’s expectations (\\(E_f^e\\)).\nIn general, the indirect short-run effect of a permanent increase in any given exogenous variable \\(X\\) on any endogenous variable \\(Z\\) can be deduced as follows: First, look at the \\(X\\)-row and \\(E_f\\)-column of Table 10.1 to see whether the long-run equilibrium value of \\(E_f\\) will increase or decrease if \\(X\\) increases.1 Second, look at the \\(E_f^e\\)-row of table Table 12.1 to see whether the endogenous variable \\(Z\\) will increase or decrease. In this way, we can deduce the secondary effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Z\\).\nActually, the process of figuring out the secondary effect of exogenous variable \\(X\\) on endogenous variable \\(Z\\) can be further simplified. The second step in the last paragraph is actually unnecessary. To see why, note that the \\(E_f^e\\)-row of table Table 12.1 has all plus (\\(+\\)) signs, indicating that any change in \\(E_f^e\\) causes all the relevant endogenous variables to change in the same direction. Therefore, if you know that an increase in \\(X\\) leads to an increase (respectively, a decrease) in \\(E_f^e\\), you can immediately conclude that the secondary effect of an increase in \\(X\\) will lead to an increase (respectively, a decrease) in all endogenous variables including \\(Z\\).\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: Short-Run Behavior under Flexible Exchange Rates: permanent changes. All variables named in the first column are exogenous and all variables listed in the first row are endogenous. Each cell in the table shows the relation between the exogenous variable and the endogenous variable aligned with the cell. The +/?/- symbols denote a direct/ambiguous/inverse relation. A blank cell denotes that there is no relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.3 The Total Effect\nIt is now time to add the primary and secondary effects of a permanent increase in government spending and thereby deduce the total effects.\n\nprimary effect of a permanent increase in \\(G\\) (same as the temporary effects in table Table 12.1): \\(Y\\uparrow\\), \\(C\\uparrow\\), \\(R\\uparrow\\), \\(NX\\downarrow\\), \\(E\\downarrow\\), \\(q\\downarrow\\)\neffect of a permanent increase in \\(G\\) on expectations (see Table 10.1): \\(E_f^e\\downarrow\\)\nsecondary effect of a permanent increase in \\(G\\) (same as the effect on \\(E_f^e\\)): \\(Y\\downarrow\\), \\(C\\downarrow\\), \\(R\\downarrow\\), \\(NX\\downarrow\\), \\(E\\downarrow\\), \\(q\\downarrow\\)\ntotal effect: \\(Y?\\), \\(C?\\), \\(R?\\), \\(NX\\downarrow\\), \\(E\\downarrow\\), \\(q\\downarrow\\), where “\\(?\\)” stands for an ambiguous effect\n\nNote that when the direct and indirect effects go in opposite directions, the total effect is, unfortunately, ambiguous.\nThe total effects are summarized in the \\(G\\)-row of table Table 13.1. It is straightforward to check that the short-run effects of a permanent increase in business investment (\\(I\\uparrow\\)) are identical, which is why \\(G\\) and \\(I\\) share the same row in table Table 13.1.\nNote that the primary and secondary effects of a permanent increase in government spending on real output run in opposite directions. The primary effect leads to higher \\(Y\\) and the secondary effect leads to lower \\(Y\\). As a result, the effect of a permanent fiscal stimulus on output is weaker than that of a temporary stimulus. Indeed, I cannot rule out the possibility that the secondary effect may be stronger than the primary effect, in which case a fiscal stimulus can be counterproductive and lead to lower real output.",

    "text": "13.3 Conclusion\nFrom the point of view of policy making, it is important to note that the short-run effect of a permanent change in government spending and/or taxes is weaker than—or, possibly, even the reverse of—a temporary change. A temporary increase in government spending on, say, the construction of roads, bridges, etc., or a temporary tax cut stimulates demand and leads to an increase in output and the creation of new jobs for the jobless. But there is less reason to be optimistic about the short-run stimulative effect of a permanent increase in government spending or a permanent tax cut. A permanent fiscal stimulus will, in the long run, raise the value of the domestic currency (\\(E_f\\downarrow\\)). Knowing this, people will revise upward their expectations about the future value of the domestic currency (\\(E_f^e\\downarrow\\)), and will do so immediately. This will reduce the competitiveness of domestic goods—as can be checked from the \\(E_f^e\\)-row of table Table 12.1, \\(q\\downarrow\\), which implies that foreign goods become relatively cheaper—and lead to a fall in net exports, lower output, and fewer jobs.\nIn other words, a permanent fiscal stimulus creates jobs and destroys jobs at the same time, and the overall effect could go either way.\nOf course, a lot depends on the assumption that expectations (\\(E_f^e\\)) are tightly linked to the long-run equilibrium outcome (\\(E_{fLR}\\)). I have assumed that as soon as a permanent increase in government spending is announced, the people will figure out that \\(E_f\\) will end up higher than they had previously thought. As a result, \\(E_f^e\\) will increase rightaway. This is at the root of the adverse secondary effect that says that net exports will fall and, consequently, output will shrink. But if, in the real world, people do not put two and two together and do not revise their expectations immediately after the increase in \\(G\\), then the adverse secondary effect would not happen, and the fiscal stimulus will work unobstructed.\nA monetary stimulus, in stark contrast, has a stronger effect when it is permanent. Perhaps a policy lesson that we can take from this chapter is that a government facing a recession should use a temporary fiscal stimulus and a permanent monetary stimulus.",

    "text": "14.1 Inadequate Foreign Currency Reserves\nIn a fixed exchange rate system, the nation’s central bank stands ready to buy and/or sell any amount of the domestic currency at a specified rate called the peg. For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve may announce that it will buy and sell U.S. dollars at the pegged rate of 1.50 British pounds per dollar. If such an announcement is in fact made, the market value of the U.S. dollar would immediately become 1.50 pounds per dollar.1\nIf, following such an announcement, people turn up at the Fed’s offices to buy dollars with the pounds they are carrying, the Fed will simply (i) add those pounds to its reserves of foreign currencies and (ii) print new dollar bills to pay the people. So, two things happen: the Fed’s foreign currency reserves , \\(R\\), increase and the U.S. money supply, \\(M\\), increases.\nWhen people appear at the Fed to sell dollars for pounds, the opposite happens: the Fed’s pound reserves and the U.S. money supply both decrease.\nSo, if exchange rates are fixed, a country’s reserves of foreign currencies, \\(R\\), and its money supply, \\(M\\), will either increase together or decrease together or stay unchanged.\nNow, under fixed exchange rates, what are the circumstances in which \\(M\\) might decrease? If you look at my earlier discussion of the short-run behavior of a fixed exchange rate system—especially Table 11.1, which summarizes the main results—you will notice that \\(M\\) will decrease if:\nWhen any of these events occur, \\(M\\) will decline and, as was just explained, the decline in \\(M\\) will be accompanied by a decline in \\(R\\). (By the way, you can check that many of these effects are also true in the long run; see Table 10.2.)\nLet’s say that one of the events listed above actually happens raising the possibility of a decline in \\(M\\)—and, therefore, in \\(R\\). In other words, people are expected to start arriving at the Fed to buy some of the Fed’s stash of British pounds. Specifically, let’s say that the people are expected to line up at the Fed’s door—not all at once but, say, over a two month period—to spend one trillion dollars to buy pounds at the Fed’s announced rate of 1.50 pounds per dollar. So, if the process reaches its expected completion, one trillion dollars will disappear from people’s wallets into the Fed’s vaults—meaning that \\(M\\) will decline by one trillion dollars—and \\(R\\), the Fed’s pound reserves, will decline by 1.50 trillion pounds.\nBut what if the Fed had only 1.00 trillion pounds to begin with? Clearly, the Fed would run out of pounds before all those who wanted to buy pounds could do so. Therefore, the Fed will ultimately have to take back its promise to buy pounds at $1.50 per pound and, therefore, abandon its fixed exchange rate system altogether. That is, the Fed will be forced to switch to a flexible exchange rate system, which entails no promises of any kind.\nThe question then is, will the dollar’s value increase or decrease when the fixed exchange rate system ends and the flexible exchange rate system begins? The answer is simple: the dollar’s value will have to fall when the Fed stops buying dollars with its pound reserves. When the Fed buys dollars it props up the dollar’s value. So when the Fed stops buying dollars, the demand for and, therefore, the value of the dollar will decline.\nTo summarize,\nthen an abrupt collapse of the fixed exchange rate system sometime ahead in the future followed by a sharp decline in the value of the home country’s currency will be widely anticipated.\nBut if people fear a decline in the dollar’s value in two months time, what would they do?\nFearing a fall in the value of the dollar, people will try to sell the dollar for pounds while the dollar is still (temporarily) high. But this will only accelerate the emptying of the central bank’s reserves and hasten the abandonment of the peg. In short, if something happens that would cause people to sell dollars, then that itself would cause more people to want to sell dollars.\nLet’s say that initially people believe that the fixed exchange rate system would have to be abandoned by the Fed in two months (i.e., eight weeks) and that the dollar’s value would fall at that time. It would then be rational to want to sell dollars for pounds seven weeks from today. But people will quickly realize that, therefore, the Fed would run out of pounds not eight weeks from today but seven weeks from today. In other words, people would expect the dollar’s value to fall seven weeks from today. Realizing this, individuals would now want to sell their dollars one week earlier, i.e., six weeks from today. But then people would quickly realize that since it is advantageous for everybody to do that, the dollar’s value will fall not eight weeks from today but just six weeks from today. And so on and on. Continuing in this way, we realize that the first whiff of a future currency crisis would cause an immediate currency crisis. There would be a mad dash for the exits as people try, all at the same time, to sell their dollars to the Fed for pounds. The Fed would lose all its pounds before it even realized what had happened.\nLet’s look at the whole process in a slightly different way. Saying that a sharp decline in \\(e\\) will be widely anticipated is like saying that \\(e_g^e\\) will decrease. And as was discussed earlier, this will add to the downward pressure on \\(M\\) and hasten the demise of the fixed exchange rate system because the added downward pressure on \\(M\\) implies an added downward pressure on \\(R\\), which would lead people to expect an even quicker exhaustion of the central bank’s foreign currency reserves. But if people accordingly revise their prediction of the likely date of the death of the fixed exchange rate system, it would mean a further decline in \\(e_g^e\\) which would further hasten the demise of the fixed exchange rate system, and so on.\nIn short, a currency crisis occurs in two stages. First, something happens—either \\(i^*\\), \\(e\\) or \\(t\\) increases or \\(P^*\\), \\(Y^p\\), \\(\\pi^e\\), \\(e_g^e\\) , \\(G\\), \\(c\\) or \\(\\theta\\) decreases—that reduces \\(M\\) and \\(R\\). Second, there is a series of declines in \\(e_g^e\\) that finish the job off. What is scary is that even the first stage, in which the currency crisis is born, may consist of a decline in \\(e_g^e\\). So, the whole crisis, from beginning to end, may occur simply because of a possibly baseless fear that the currency’s value would fall. That initially baseless fear could set in motion a self-fulfilling prophecy that would end up confirming the fear.",

    "text": "14.2 Currency Boards\nWhat is even scarier is that a currency crisis can occur even if the central bank has adequate foreign currency reserves, in which case the fixed exchange rate system is called a currency board . To see why, let us return briefly to Table 11.1, the table that summarizes the results for an economy in the short-run under fixed exchange rates. Note that the columns for \\(M\\) and \\(Y\\) are virtually identical. So, \\(M\\) and \\(Y\\) usually move in the same direction; if something happens that makes \\(M\\) decrease it will very likely also make \\(Y\\) decrease. Now, when \\(Y\\) decreases, the country’s government, fearful of becoming unpopular, will be tempted to devalue the currency (that is, it will be tempted to reduce the pegged value of \\(e\\)) in order to reverse the decline in \\(Y\\). And if a sudden sharp decline in \\(e\\) is widely anticipated, a currency crisis will develop just as before: \\(e_g^e\\) will go down making a bad situation worse and, as we saw earlier, this itself might precipitate a currency crisis.\nSo, the possibility that the central bank will abandon fixed exchange rates either because it has inadequate reserves or because it will have to do something about the declining \\(Y\\), could precipitate a currency crisis.",

    "section": "14.3 Dealing with a Currency Crisis",
    "text": "14.3 Dealing with a Currency Crisis\nTable 11.1 suggests several ways of dealing with an unfolding currency crisis: increase government spending, \\(G\\), cut taxes, \\(t\\), or raise tariffs, \\(\\theta\\), on imported goods. As the table shows, if any or all of these things are done, \\(M\\) and, therefore, \\(R\\) will increase, thereby reversing the initial decrease in \\(M\\) that precipitated the crisis.\nThe problem with this strategy is that the crisis is likely to happen much too quickly for \\(G\\), \\(t\\) and \\(\\theta\\) to have any timely effect. Besides, if the government is to cut taxes and increase spending at the same time, it would have to borrow money from private citizens and such borrowing may be prohibitively expensive, particularly since it is being done in the middle of a currency crisis. And as for tariffs, the effect on \\(M\\) is likely to be weak.\nSo, what’s to be done?\nOne way out is to get wealthy foreign governments or the International Monetary Fund to come to the crisis country’s aid with a generous line of credit. Suppose people have begun arriving at the Fed to buy British pounds. If it transpires that the Fed has an inadequate stock of pounds, the orderly process of people lining up to buy pounds could quickly turn into a full-fledged currency crisis, as we saw earlier. But if some wealthy foreign government or the IMF steps in with a large loan of British pounds for the Fed, the fear that the fed will run out of pounds will go away and, therefore, the currency crisis itself will go away.\nOf course, the Fed will have to pay those borrowed British pounds back eventually. Therefore, if nothing is done between now and ‘eventually’, the crisis will return. Consequently, all that foreign loans can do is buy the U.S. some time. If the breathing space thus obtained is used to reverse the decline in \\(M\\)—by increasing \\(G\\) and reducing \\(t\\), as was discussed in the first paragraph of this section—then the crisis will truly end. Emergency infusions of foreign currency reserves combined with necessary changes in domestic policy can effectively bring a currency crisis to an end.\nHowever, all this, while fine in theory, is very tricky to pull off right in the middle of an actual currency crisis. Therefore, we need to focus on prevention.",

    "section": "14.4 Preventing a Currency Crisis",
    "text": "14.4 Preventing a Currency Crisis\nWhat can be done to prevent a currency crisis? There are three possibilities.\n\nDon’t have a fixed exchange rate system in the first place. Have flexible exchange rates instead. However, the downside of a flexible exchange rate system is that the uncertainty associated with the exchange rate fluctuations that might follow would reduce trade and, therefore, hurt the country’s economic health.\nMake sure the central bank piles up enough foreign exchange reserves so that it will never run out—that is, adopt the currency board system. For example, suppose 2 trillion dollars have been printed so far. If the Fed announces a peg of 1.50 pounds per dollar and if the Fed has 3 trillion British pounds in its reserves, then it will never run out of pounds: Not even if every single dollar out there is sold to the Fed for pounds. However, this system—the currency board—is not foolproof. As was pointed out in Section 14.2, a currency crisis can occur even when there are enough reserves.\nJoin up with other countries with which you wanted to have fixed exchange rates and jointly decide to adopt a single currency for all countries. This system—called a currency union —would allow all the advantages of a fixed exchange rate system without the fear of periodic currency crises.\n\nThe most important example of the currency union solution to the problem of currency crises is the European Monetary Union and the birth of the Euro and that’s our next topic.",
