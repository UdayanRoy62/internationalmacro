# National Income Accounts, Prices, and Inflation {#sec-niaccounts}

Recall from sections @sec-economics -- @sec-intmac that international macroeconomics consists of explanations for the observed up-and-down movements of important macroeconomic variables in a globalized (or, open) economy. This chapter begins the task of defining some of those important macroeconomic variables. This chapter also discusses certain accounting rules that describe how certain important macroeconomic variables are related to each other, simply by virtue of the way they are defined.

## National Income Accounts {#sec-nia}

The national income accounts of a country consist of data on variables that tell us about the country's total production of goods and services, and what those goods and services are being used for. An important measure of the total production of goods and services is the gross domestic product (GDP). If you look up a country's GDP data in a book or on the Internet, you'll see that GDP data comes in two flavors, nominal and real. Nominal GDP is discussed in the next section, and real GDP is discussed in the section after that.

## Nominal Gross Domestic Product {#sec-nGDP} 
\index{gross domestic product!nominal}

There are three equivalent ways of understanding nominal gross domestic product: the value-added approach, the income approach, and the expenditure approach.

### GDP: The Value-Added Approach {#sec-gdp-value-added}

The **value added**\index{value added} by a firm is the monetary market value of the goods and services produced by the firm *minus* the monetary market value of the goods and services that the firm purchases from other firms (for use in its own production, obviously). A country's gross domestic product is then the total value added---during a specified time period, such as a year---by all producers of for-sale goods located within the country.

Consider a university. Let's say that the market value of the educational services provided by this university was \$20 m during 2008, as measured by the tuition paid by its students. It would be incorrect, however, to say that the market value of the work done in the university was \$20 m. The university used a lot of electricity that was produced by some other firm. The university bought massive amounts of paper, computer printer cartridges, and other stationery from other firms. The university's capital equipment (which includes its buildings, its computers, its fleet of cars and trucks, etc.) needed costly replacements that had to be bought from other firms. Suppose the monetary market value of these and all other goods and services that were purchased from other firms and used by the university's employees during 2008 was \$16 m. Then the value added by the university was only \$20 m -- \$16 m = \$4 m.

And, as we saw two paragraphs back, *the total value added by all producers of for-sale goods and services located within a country's borders is that country's gross domestic product*.

### GDP: The Income Approach {#sec-gdp-income}

Now, returning to our hypothetical university, a question arises: What happens to the \$4 m that the university has left of its \$20 m tuition revenues after paying \$16 m to other firms for its various purchases? Where will this \$4 m go?

A big chunk will go to pay **wages** to the university's employees. The university will have to pay **rent** on some property that it had leased from others. It will have to pay **interest** to its banks for the loans it had taken. It will have to pay what are called **indirect business taxes** to the government. And whatever remains will be the university's **profits**, which belong to the university's owners or shareholders. In other words, the university's value added ends up as the income of the owners of the resources employed by the university.

What's true for this university is true for all firms in the country. Therefore, as a country's gross domestic product is its total value added, one can say that *a country's gross domestic product is the total income earned by the owners of all the resources employed by producers located within the country's borders*.

### GDP: The Expenditure Approach {#sec-gdp-expenditure}

Let us consider our hypothetical university one more time. The education it provides its students is an example of a **final good**.^[When I say "good", I mean "good or service".] A good is called a final good when it is sold to its final user; a final user is someone who will not use the purchased good to produce something else for sale.

The electricity, paper, other stationery, etc., that the university buys for the purpose of producing educational services are called **intermediate goods**. When goods are bought by businesses from other businesses, used as inputs in the production of other for-sale goods, and, in the process, end up disappearing completely inside those other goods, they are called intermediate goods\index{goods!intermediate}. (Think of all the milk produced by U.S. dairy farmers that disappear into the ice cream made by U.S. firms such as Ben & Jerry's.)

In my example, students paid \$20 m for education, the final good produced by the university. As we saw in section @sec-gdp-income above, this money ends up as the incomes of all the resources---employed by the university and by the firms from which the university bought electricity, paper, and all sorts of other intermediate goods---that were used to produce the final good, education.

Extrapolating from this example, we can say that the total expenditure on all final goods produced domestically and sold to domestic final users---let's call these goods category $a$ goods---is equal to the income earned by all resources employed in the production of these final goods and the intermediate goods used in the production of these final goods.

Moreover, what's true for education must also be true for the domestic production of all exported goods---let's call these category $b$ goods. The total expenditure on these goods must end up as the total income of all resources used to make these goods and the intermediate goods bought by the producers of these goods.

Therefore, the total expenditure on the goods in categories $a$ and $b$ *minus* the value of the intermediate goods imported by the producers of category $a$ and $b$ goods is the total income of all resources that were used to make category $a$ and $b$ goods and the *domestically produced* intermediate goods bought by their producers.

But this income must be the total income of all resources employed in
domestic production. After all, any domestic producer would have to
produce either final goods sold to domestic buyers (category $a$), or
exported goods (category $b$), or the domestically produced intermediate
goods bought by category $a$ and $b$ producers.

Therefore, going by the definition of GDP in @sec-gdp-income,
the total expenditure on category $a$ and $b$ goods *minus* imports of
intermediate goods equals gross domestic product.

In publications of government statistics, the total expenditure by
households residing within a country is called **personal consumption
expenditure** or, simply, consumption. The total spending on final goods
by domestic businesses is called **gross private domestic investment**
or, simply, investment. Total spending by domestic government entities
is called **government expenditure**. Therefore, total expenditure on
*all* final goods by domestic residents is consumption $+$ investment
$+$ government spending. Consequently, total expenditure on final goods
produced domestically and sold to domestic residents---category $a$---is
consumption $+$ investment $+$ government spending $-$ imports of final
goods. Therefore, the total expenditure on goods in categories $a$ and
$b$ equals consumption $+$ investment $+$ government spending $+$
exports $-$ imports of final goods. Therefore, recalling the last
sentence of the previous paragraph, gross domestic product equals
consumption $+$ investment $+$ government spending $+$ exports $-$
imports of final goods $-$ imports of intermediate goods. Consequently,
we get:

$$
\text{GDP}=\text{Consumption}+\text{Investment}+\text{Government Purchases}+\text{Exports}-\text{Imports}.
$$ {#eq-gdp1}

This is easily the most important equation in this book. It is called the **national income identity**\index{national income identity} and will be central to our discussion right up to the very end of this book.

Note that it is not terribly meaningful to distinguish between exports of final goods and exports of intermediate goods. And the same can be said about imports too. Nevertheless, if we simplify a bit and assume that all exports and imports are of final goods, @eq-gdp1 can be interpreted as follows: a country's gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services produced within the country in a given period of time (usually a year). This is a very popular definition that you will see in many textbooks. I will use this definition in this book too, as a convenient shorthand.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the nominal GDP of the United States for `r max(my_data$date)-9` was \$`r format(my_data$GDPA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 9], scientific = FALSE)` billion. This means that spending by US residents on the final goods and services that were "Made in USA" in `r max(my_data$date)-9` plus net exports of "Made in USA" goods and services were together equal to a grand total of \$`r format(my_data$GDPA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 9], scientific = FALSE)` billion. This number is also the total value added by all producers located in the USA. And---perhaps most meaningfully---this number is the total income earned by all productive resources employed by producers located in the USA.

<!--

-->

## Real Gross Domestic Product {#sec-rGDP}
\index{gross domestic product!real}

Looking at the second column in @tbl-gdp-n-deflator, we see
that the nominal gross domestic product of the United States increased from 
\$`r format(my_data$GDPA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 9], scientific = FALSE)` billion in `r max(my_data$date)-9` to 
\$`r format(my_data$GDPA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 8], scientific = FALSE)` billion in `r max(my_data$date)-8` and to 
\$`r format(my_data$GDPA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 7], scientific = FALSE)` billion in `r max(my_data$date)-7`. If one assumes that our quality of life depends crucially on the goods and services we produce, these ever increasing dollar figures seem like good news.

But are they?

As nominal gross domestic product is the monetary market value of all final goods produced, it could increase from one year to the next either as a result of:

*  increases in the production of various goods, or
*  increases in the market prices of those goods, or
*  increases in both production and prices.

Consequently, increases in nominal gross domestic product do not
necessarily imply increases in production. Mere inflation could make the numbers go up and up.

Now if, by sheer luck, all prices remained unchanged during `r max(my_data$date) - 9` -- `r max(my_data$date) - 7`, then, yes, the increases in nominal GDP during that period would indeed strongly indicate rising overall levels of
production.^[Even in this case, production might rise for some goods and fall for others. But it is straightforward to show that if nominal GDP rises and prices stay unchanged, a country would be able to buy increasing amounts of *every* good through international trade.]

Of course, in real life, prices do not stay unchanged year after year. But even if prices moved around a lot during  `r max(my_data$date) - 9` -- `r max(my_data$date) - 7`, we could still ask a hypothetical question: What would nominal GDP have been during  `r max(my_data$date) - 9` -- `r max(my_data$date) - 7` if prices had remained unchanged at `r max(my_data$date) - 9` levels? This is not an unanswerable question. We know the `r max(my_data$date) - 9` prices of all final goods, and we know the quantities produced, of all final goods, during the years `r max(my_data$date) - 9`, `r max(my_data$date) - 8` and `r max(my_data$date) - 7`. (Otherwise, we would not have been able to calculate the nominal GDP figures in @tbl-gdp-n-deflator.) Therefore, we can easily calculate what America's nominal GDP would have been in those years, had the prices of `r max(my_data$date) - 9` prevailed in all years.

Indeed, data on this hypothetical measure---formally called **real gross domestic product** or **constant-prices gross domestic product** or **inflation-adjusted gross domestic product**---is available for virtually every country in the world. The third column of @tbl-gdp-n-deflator shows America's real gross domestic product, calculated on the assumption that the prices of the year 2017 prevailed in all years, for the decade
`r max(my_data$date) - 9`-- `r max(my_data$date)`.^[Formally, these numbers are in "chained 2017 dollars". The subtleties of this particular method of adjusting nominal values for inflation will not concern us here.]

As you can see, not only did America's nominal GDP increase throughout `r max(my_data$date) - 9`-- `r max(my_data$date)`, so did *real* GDP. This is clear evidence of actual increases in production. To repeat, the dollar figures in the third column of @tbl-gdp-n-deflator were all calculated on the hypothetical assumption that 2017's prices prevailed in every year. As the same prices were used for every year's real GDP calculations, the increases in real GDP strongly indicate overall increases in production.

The year whose prices are being assumed hypothetically to prevail in all years---the year 2017 in this case---is called the **base year**. There is nothing sacrosanct about the year 2017---any other year could have served just as well. As long as every year's GDP is calculated using the same set of prices, we will get a measure of GDP that is not affected by fluctuations in the overall level of prices.

In the rest of this book, all references to gross domestic product are references to *real* gross domestic product. Also, I will use the symbol $Y$ to denote real gross domestic product.

### Notation: Growth Rates {#sec-notngrowth}

Consider a variable $x$. I will denote its *current value* as simply $x$ and its *past value* as $x_{-1}$. Then, the *growth rate* of $x$, which I will denote $x_g$, can be defined as follows: 
$$
x_g\equiv\frac{x-x_{-1}}{x_{-1}}.
$$ {#eq-growthrate}

Here, $x-x_{-1}$ represents the increase in the value of
$x$. Therefore, $(x-x_{-1})/x_{-1}$ is the proportionate increase in the value of $x$ or, simply, the growth rate of $x$. If $x_{-1}=50$ and $x=60$, the increase is $x-x_{-1}=60-50=10$. But the rate of growth is $x_g\equiv(x-x_{-1})/x_{-1}=(60-50)/50=0.20$.

If you want the growth rate *as a percentage*, simply multiply $x_g$ by 100 to get $0.20\times100=20$ percent.

To take a more concrete example, consider real gross domestic product ($Y$) and its growth rate ($Y_g$). @tbl-gdp-n-deflator
tells us that real GDP of the U.S. (in billions of chained 2017
dollars), was \$`r format(my_data$GDPCA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 9], scientific = FALSE)` in `r max(my_data$date) - 9` and \$`r format(my_data$GDPCA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 8], scientific = FALSE)` in `r max(my_data$date) - 8`. Therefore, the growth rate of America's real GDP in `r max(my_data$date) - 8` was 
$$
Y_{g,`r max(my_data$date) - 8`}=\frac{Y_{`r max(my_data$date) - 8`}-Y_{`r max(my_data$date) - 9`}}{Y_{`r max(my_data$date) - 9`}} = \frac{`r format(my_data$GDPCA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 8], scientific = FALSE)`-`r format(my_data$GDPCA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 9], scientific = FALSE)`}{`r format(my_data$GDPCA[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 9], scientific = FALSE)`}\times 100 = `r round(my_data$GDPCA_growth[my_data$date == max(my_data$date) - 8], 2)`
$$
percent. The real GDP growth rates for the decade `r max(my_data$date) - 9`--`r max(my_data$date)` are given in @tbl-growth-inflation.

For my discussion of the theory of international macroeconomics, I will also use a *forward-looking* definition of the growth rate of a variable. Specifically, the **forward-looking growth rate** of $x$ is defined as follows: 
$$
x_g\equiv\frac{x_f-x}{x}.
$$ {#eq-f-growthrate}

Here, $x_f$ represents the value of $x$ in the future. Therefore, $x_f-x$ represents the increase in the value of $x$. Therefore, $(x_f-x)/x$ is the proportionate increase in the value of $x$
or, simply, the growth rate of $x$.

## The Components of GDP {#sec-gdp-components}

Now that we have discussed the measurement of a country's total
production, let us look at what happens to it. Government statisticians typically publish data not only on a country's output of final goods and services (that is, its GDP) but also on who bought those final goods and services. As in @fig-gdp-components, national income data usually breaks down the big GDP number into four smaller numbers that represent the final-goods purchases made by four major categories of
buyers:

*  personal consumption expenditures ($C$),
*  gross private domestic investment ($I$), 
*  government purchases ($G$), and
*  net exports of goods and services ($NX$).

In other words, @eq-gdp1, which is called the national
income identity and breaks down *nominal* gross domestic product into its components, is equally true for *real* gross domestic product:
$$
Y=C+I+G+NX.
$$ {#eq-nii}

### Consumption {#sec-consumption-nia}
\index{consumption!personal consumption expenditures}

The real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) **personal consumption
expenditures** of the residents of a country in a given year is denoted by the symbol $C$. In U.S. data, $C$ consists of *spending by households* on all final goods except newly built homes. As you can see from the U.S. data in @fig-gdp-components-percent, $C$ is a
very large part---more than two-thirds---of GDP.

### Investment {#sec-investment-nia}
\index{investment!gross private domestic investment}

The real **gross private domestic investment** (or, simply, investment)
of a country is denoted by the symbol $I$. In U.S. data, $I$ consists of:

*  the purchases of fixed assets (equipment, software, and buildings) by businesses for use in production,
*  the purchases of new homes by households,^[As we saw in the previous paragraph, this is the only category of household spending that is *not* included in $C$.] and
*  increases in inventories of unsold goods held by businesses.

Note that the inclusion of these three categories of final goods under investment is not random. There is an underlying theme here: machines, new buildings, stocks of as-yet-unsold goods, etc., all contribute to our *future* welfare.^[The first two categories---fixed assets and new homes---are combined into the *fixed investment* category in @fig-gdp-components.] The money we spend on pizzas and backrubs, by contrast, are all about the here and now and are included under consumption, $C$.

As you can see from the U.S. data in @fig-gdp-components-percent, $I$, at less than 15% of GDP, is a lot less important than $C$. And yet, because of its tendency to fluctuate wildly, investment spending is an important cause of the ups and downs of the overall economy.

#### Inventories {#sec-inventories} 
\index{investment!inventories}

The inclusion of increases in businesses' stocks of unsold goods in $I$ needs some justification. What's the point of including this in $I$?

Keep in mind that to get an accurate picture of the health of an economy in a given year we need to count the market value of all goods and services produced during the year, whether or not they are sold by December 31st of that year. Those unsold goods would not be counted in $C$, $I$, $G$, and $NX$, if these four variables included only the actual *purchases* of final goods by households, businesses, the government, and foreign buyers. To make sure that all goods produced in 2008 get counted in that year's GDP---even if they are not sold in 2008---statisticians include the additions of unsold goods to businesses' inventories (or, warehouse stocks) in $I$.

Note that I did not say that additions to businesses' inventories of unsold *final* goods are included in $I$; even the intermediate goods that were produced in 2008 but not sold by the end of that year need to be counted in that year's GDP.

Sure, as the ice cream made by Ben & Jerry's is counted in GDP, one should not separately count the milk that went into it because the monetary market value of the ice cream already includes the monetary market value of the milk. But let's complicate the story a little. Suppose Ben & Jerry's buys \$10 million of freshly produced milk some time in 2008, but does not turn it into ice cream by December 31, 2008. Instead, the milk is sitting in their freezer on that last day of 2008, waiting to be turned into Cherry Garcia some time in 2009. This \$10 million worth of milk was produced in 2008 and, therefore, should be included in 2008's GDP. To ensure this, the rules of GDP accounting require that any goods that have been added to the inventories (or, warehouse stocks of goods) of private businesses during 2008 are *final* goods and their value must be counted in the GDP for 2008.

### Government Spending {#sec-government-spending-nia}
\index{government spending}

Real **government expenditures** ($G$) is pretty much what it sounds
like; it is the inflation-adjusted monetary value of all final goods and
services bought by government entities.

Typically, governments also spend huge amounts of money on **transfer payments** or, loosely speaking, gifts (usually to needy people). But $G$ includes only the money spent on the purchase of final goods and does not include transfer payments.

### Net Exports {#sec-netexports-nia}
\index{net exports}

Real **exports of goods and services** ($EX$) is the inflation-adjusted
value of all domestically produced goods that are bought by
foreigners.\index{exports}

Real **imports of goods and services** ($IM$) is the inflation-adjusted
value of all foreign-made goods that are bought by domestic
residents.\index{imports}

Real **net exports** ($NX$) is then defined as $NX\equiv EX-IM$. This
also goes by other names, such as **trade surplus**, **balance on goods
and services**, and, somewhat loosely, **balance on the current
account**---see @eq-balancedef.\index{trade surplus}\index{current account!balance}
Note, therefore, that $NX$ could be positive, zero or negative. When
$NX$ is positive/zero/negative, the country is said to have a **Trade
Surplus/Balanced Trade/a Trade Deficit**.

#### All exports and imports are final! {#sec-exp-imp-final}

There's one more loose end in my definition of GDP that I need to tie up. 
Note that in @sec-netexports-nia above I defined exports as "all domestically produced goods that are bought by foreigners", not all domestically produced *final* goods". Similarly, note that I defined imports as "all foreign-made goods that are bought by domestic residents", not all foreign-made *final* goods". Why am I including exports and imports of intermediate goods? 
Suppose that American dairy farmers produce \$10 million of milk in 2008 and sell it to a Canadian ice cream company that turns the milk into ice cream in its plant in Vancouver, also in 2008.
The monetary value of the ice cream would not be counted in America's GDP because the ice cream was made in Canada. So, if the \$10 million of milk is regarded as an intermediate good, it would not be counted at all
in America's GDP. When the milk is turned into ice cream by Ben &
Jerry's, the ice cream is counted in America's GDP and, therefore, so is
the milk, although indirectly. But as for the milk that is sold to a
Canadian ice cream company, the only way to have it counted in America's
GDP is to require that *anything* sold to foreigners is counted in $EX$.
Similarly, it is straightforward to show that imports of intermediate
goods should be counted in the importing country's $IM$. 

So, here's the
final corrected version---fingers crossed!---of the definition of gross
domestic product: *GDP is the monetary market value of all final goods
and services produced within a country in a given year plus the increase
in its inventories of intermediate goods plus its net exports of
intermediate goods*.

## The National Income Identity {#sec-ni-identity}

To recap, we have so far defined real gross domestic product ($Y$), real
personal consumption expenditure ($C$), real gross private domestic
investment ($I$), real government spending ($G$), and real exports
($EX$). It is tempting to argue that $Y$ must be equal to $C+I+G+EX$.
After all, $Y$ represents all final goods that are "Made in USA" and
any such good would have to be bought either by American households
($C$), or by American businesses ($I$), or by America's government
($G$), or by foreigners ($EX$). Therefore, $Y$ should be equal to
$C+I+G+EX$, right?

Well, not exactly. Although $C+I+G$, which incidentally is referred to as **gross domestic purchases**\index{gross domestic purchases}, does represent the total purchases by domestic households, businesses, and
government entities, it includes purchases of imported goods as well as domestically produced goods. Therefore, only if we subtract the inflation-adjusted monetary value of all imported goods (denoted by the symbol $IM$) from $C+I+G+EX$ would we get $Y$. That is, $Y=C+I+G+EX-IM$.

As we saw in @sec-netexports-nia, the terms **net exports**,
**trade surplus**, and **balance on goods and services** all refer to $NX\equiv EX-IM$, the excess of exports over imports. Therefore, we get the **national income identity**\index{national income identity}:
$$
Y=C+I+G+NX.
$$ {#eq-ni-identity}

This is a reappearance of @eq-gdp1 and @eq-nii.

@fig-gdp-components shows data on real gross domestic
product and its components for the United States for the years 2005--8.
You can check that $C+I+G+NX$ is indeed equal to real GDP.

A theoretically equivalent measure is **gross domestic income**. When
government statisticians measure the total value added by domestic
producers, they measure the gross domestic product (GDP). When they
measure the total income of all resources employed by domestic
producers, they measure gross domestic income (GDI). As we have seen
above, if measured with perfect accuracy, these two magnitudes should be
the same, as they are theoretically equivalent. In practice, however,
errors do creep in, and the GDP and GDI numbers tend to differ. This
difference is called the **statistical discrepancy**:
$GDP=GDI+\text{statistical discrepancy}$.

### Beyond GDP: Other Measures of Total Production {#sec-beyond-gdp}

Gross domestic product is not the only measure of a country's total production, there are others.

#### Gross National Product {#sec-gnp}
\index{gross national product}

Recall that a country's gross domestic product is not only the total
value added by all producers located within the country, it is also
equal to gross domestic income, which is the total income earned by the
factors of production (or, in plain language, resources) employed by all
producers located within the
country.^[In other words, if measured accurately, GDP $=$ GDI.]

Some of the resources employed by producers located within the country
may be owned by foreign residents, and the income paid to these
resources goes, necessarily, to their foreign owners. Conversely, some
residents of the domestic country may earn income for work done for
producers located in foreign countries. A country's **net factor income
earned from foreign residents** ($NIF$) *equals* total income earned by
domestic residents from foreign residents *minus* total income paid by
domestic residents to foreign residents.

As, in some cases, it is important to know the total income earned by
the factors of production owned by a country's residents, we often pay
attention to a country's gross national product (GNP): 
$$
\text{GNP}=\text{GDP}+\text{NIF}.
$$ {#eq-gnp}

A theoretically equivalent measure is gross national income:
$GNI=GDI+NIF$. Recall from @sec-ni-identity that although GDP
and GDI are theoretically the same, and would be equal if accurately measure, in practice the measured magnitudes differ slightly:
$GDP=GDI+\text{statistical discrepancy}$. The same distinction needs to
be made between GNP and GNI as well; they'd be equal if measured
accurately, but in practice $GNP=GNI+\text{statistical discrepancy}$.

#### Gross National Disposable Income {#sec-gndi}
\index{gross national disposable income}

The residents of a country may send gifts to---and receive gifts
from---the residents of other countries. A country's **net unilateral transfers of income from foreign residents** (NUT) is defined as gifts received *minus* gifts given. Gross national disposable income (GNDI) is
then defined as 
$$
\text{GNDI}=\text{GNI}+\text{NUT}.
$$ {#eq-gndi}

Recall that gross domestic product is denoted by the symbol $Y$. In
practice, the statistical discrepancy between GDP and GDI (or between
GNP and GNI) is small. Moreover, net factor income earned from foreign
residents (NIF) and net unilateral transfers of income from foreign
residents (NUT) tend to be small too. As a result, the differences
between GDP, GDI, GNP, GNI, and GNDI are, for most practical purposes,
small enough to be ignored. Consequently, to keep the discussion simple,
I will use the symbol $Y$ to refer to *all* these different ways of
measuring a country's total value added, total income, and total
expenditure.

#### National Income Identity, Revisited {#sec-nii-2}
\index{national income identity}

Recall from @eq-ni-identity that 
$$ Y=C+I+G+NX.$$
Therefore, 
$$Y+\text{NIF}+\text{NUT}=C+I+G+NX+\text{NIF}+\text{NUT}.$$
It is clear from equations @eq-gnp and @eq-gndi, the last
equation can be re-written as 
$$
\text{GNDI}=C+I+G+(NX+\text{NIF}+\text{NUT}). 
$$

As we will see in the next chapter's discussion of balance of payments
accounting, the expression within parentheses in the last equation is
called the **balance on the current account** or, simply the current
account (CA). The equation above then yields a slightly updated version
of the national income identity: 
$$
\text{GNDI}=C+I+G+CA.
$$ {#eq-nii-ca}

The reader should be warned, however, that I will use the terms net
exports ($NX$) and current account balance ($CA=NX+NIF+NUT$)
interchangeably throughout this book, because---as was pointed out a
short while back in @sec-gndi---both $NIF$ and $NUT$ tend to be
small in magnitude.

## Prices and Inflation {#sec-p-pi}

Inflation is a topic of major concern in economics as well as in our
daily lives. Therefore, it is important to understand what causes it and
how it can be controlled. But before we can get to that, we need to
discuss how inflation is measured.

The measurement of inflation can be quite tricky. While the prices of
some goods may rise from one year to the next, the prices of other goods
may fall. In such cases, one needs to come up with *one* number that
summarizes the *overall* change in prices.

### The Implicit Price Deflator for GDP {#sec-IPDGDP} 
\index{gross domestic product!implicit price deflator for}

Suppose you recently spent a day in Boston followed by a day in San
Antonio. You ate the same meals in both cities, bought the same
newspaper, rented the same type of car, and stayed in identical hotels.
Nevertheless, you ended up spending 10% more in Boston. Why? You did not
buy more stuff in Boston; in fact, you bought exactly the same things in
both cities. Therefore, the only explanation is that prices were higher
overall in Boston. Some things may be cheaper in Boston and some other
things may be cheaper in San Antonio. But it is reasonable to
conclude---from your own limited experience in the two cities---that the
overall level of prices was 10\% higher in Boston relative to San
Antonio.

Now consider another hypothetical example. Suppose you spent both
October 1, 2005 and October 1, 2006 in Boston and during both visits you
bought the exact same things, used the same transportation, and stayed
in identical hotel rooms. And yet, you ended up spending 4% more in 2006
than in 2005. Using the same logic as in the last paragraph, we can
conclude that although individual items' prices may have changed at
different rates, the overall level of prices in Boston rose 4% in 2006
relative to 2005.

In fact, you don't even have to visit Boston on two different dates.
After your October 1, 2006 visit, you could dig up data on the prices
that you would have paid if you had visited Boston a year earlier and
bought the same goods and services that you bought during your October
1, 2006 visit, and you would have again reached the conclusion that the
overall level of prices rose 4\% in Boston in 2006. And that, by and
large, is what government statisticians do to measure the rates of
change of the overall level of prices in the US and other countries.

One way to measure the overall level of prices is to compare the nominal
GDP and the real GDP for a particular year. We see in @tbl-gdp-n-deflator that in 1999 America's nominal GDP was
\$9,353.5 billion and America's real GDP, with base year 2005, was
\$10,779.8 billion. Stated differently, in 1999 America's nominal GDP
was 86.8% of America's real GDP: 
$$
\begin{eqnarray*} 
\frac{\text{Nominal GDP in 1999}}{\text{Real GDP in 1999 with base year 2005}}\times 100&=&\frac{9,353.5}{10,779.8}\times 100\\
&=& 86.8.
\end{eqnarray*} 
$$
So, at 1999 prices, the dollar value of all final goods produced in the U.S. in 1999 was \$9,353.5 billion, whereas, at 2005 prices, the dollar value of the exact same goods was \$10,779.8 billion.

Now, how could one dollar value of the final goods made in 1999 be different from the other dollar value of the exact same goods? As the quantities used in the nominal GDP calculation are the same as the quantities used in the real GDP calculation, these two dollar values must be different because they use different *prices*.

More precisely, the only possible reason why America's nominal GDP in 1999 is 86.8% of America's real GDP in 1999 must be that the prices that prevailed in 1999, which are the ones that were used in the calculation of nominal GDP, were, in an overall sense, 86.8% as high as the prices that had prevailed in 2005, which are the ones that were used in the calculation of real GDP.

It would be incorrect to conclude that *all* final goods were 86.8% as pricey in 1999 as in 2005. For apples, the 1999 price may have been 80% of the 2005 price. For haircuts, the 1999 price may have been 130% of the 2005 price. For gas at the pump, the 1999 price may have been 99% of the 2005 price. But it is reasonable to say that in an overall sense the 1999 prices were 86.8% as high as the 2005 prices because the final goods that were produced in America in 1999 were only 86.8% as valuable at 1999 prices than at 2005 prices.

Thus, by comparing the nominal and real GDP values for a particular year we are able to measure how that year's prices as a whole measure up relative to the base year's prices. Formally, the

$$
\text{Implicit Price Deflator for GDP in year $n$ with base year $m$} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP in year $n$}}{\text{Real GDP in year $n$ with base year $m$}}\times 100
$$ {#eq-IPDGDP}
shows what the overall level of final goods' prices in year $n$ was as a percentage of the base year's overall price level. More compactly, 
$$ 
\text{Implicit Price Deflator}=
\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\times 100.
$$ {#eq-IPDGDP_compact}

The fourth column in @tbl-gdp-n-deflator shows America's implicit price deflator for GDP (IPDGDP) for the 1999--2008 decade. Specifically, it shows that the overall level of prices in 1999 was 86.8% of the overall level of prices in 2005. Similarly, the overall level of prices in 2005 was 100% of the overall level of prices in 2005---what a shocker!---and the overall price level in 2007 was 106.2% of the overall level of prices in 2005.^[If you saw @tbl-gdp-n-deflator, but without any information about 2005 being the base year in the heading of the third column, would you still be able to figure out that 2005 is the base year?]

In the remainder of these lectures, I will represent the overall price level for a particular year not by the implicit price deflator for GDP but by a very slightly different version of it: 
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
P&=&\frac{\text{Implicit Price Deflator for GDP}}{100}\nonumber \\
&=&\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\times\frac{100}{100}\nonumber \\
&=&\frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{Y}.
\end{eqnarray}
$$ {#eq-P}
Note that @eq-P comes from equation @eq-IPDGDP.

In other words, while real GDP is represented by the symbol $Y$, the overall level of prices is denoted by the symbol $P$, and nominal GDP is given by 
$$
\text{Nominal GDP}=P\times Y.
$$ {#eq-nomGDP}

### The Consumer Price Index {#sec-cpi} 
\index{consumer price index}

The implicit price deflator for GDP is not the only one-number representation of the overall level of the prices of the innumerable goods that are bought and sold in a modern economy. Indeed, it may not even be the most popular method: a frequently cited alternative measure of the overall level of prices is the **consumer price index**.

Whereas the implicit price deflator for GDP is (100 times) the value of the current year's output of final goods at the current year's prices divided by the value of the same set of goods at the base year's prices, the consumer price index is (100 times) the value of *a fixed bundle of goods that represents the purchases of a *typical consumer* at the current year's prices divided by the value of that same bundle of goods at the base year's prices.

Although @eq-P sees the overall price level, $P$, as the implicit deflator for GDP divided by 100, you may, if you wish, think of $P$ as the consumer price index divided by 100. In practical terms, these two measures of the overall price level tend to move in sync most of the time.^[However, an increase in the price of M16 rifles, which are usually bought by a country's armed forces but not by its typical consumer---not yet anyway!---would raise the value of the GDP deflator but not the CPI.]

### Inflation {#sec-inflation} 
\index{inflation!measurement}

Finally, how do we measure inflation? Inflation is defined simply as the growth rate of the overall level of prices, where the term 'growth rate' is as it is defined in @sec-notngrowth. I will denote inflation by the symbol $\pi$, which is the lower-case Greek letter 'pi'. Denoting the past value of the overall price level by the symbol $P_{-1}$, we can use equation @eq-growthrate to express inflation as follows: 
$$
\pi\equiv\frac{P-P_{-1}}{P_{-1}}\equiv\frac{P}{P_{-1}}-1.
$$ {#eq-inflation}
The increase in the overall price level is $P-P_{-1}$. But the proportionate increase in $P$ is $(P-P_{-1})/P_{-1}$. And to express inflation as a *percentage*, one has to multiply $\pi$ by 100.

For example, the annual inflation rate for, say, 2004 is
$$
\begin{eqnarray} 
{\text{Inflation during 2004}}\nonumber \\
&=&\frac{P_{2004}-P_{2003}}{P_{2003}}\times 100\\
&=&\frac{\text{IPDGDP}_{2004}-\text{IPDGDP}_{2003}}{\text{IPDGDP}_{2003}}\times 100\\
&=&\frac{96.77-94.1}{94.1}\times 100\nonumber \\
&=&2.8 \text{ percent}.\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
$$ {#eq-inflation2004}

America's annual inflation rates, as defined above, are shown in @tbl-growth-inflation for 1999--2008. Although these inflation numbers are calculated based on the implicit price deflator for GDP as the price level, one could also think of inflation as the annual percentage increase in the consumer price index, which has been discussed above in @sec-cpi. In practical terms, this does not make much difference to inflation data, especially over longer periods, as you can see in @fig-inflation. Over short periods of time, however, inflation measures based on the consumer price index are more volatile, as can be seen in @fig-cpi-volatile}.
